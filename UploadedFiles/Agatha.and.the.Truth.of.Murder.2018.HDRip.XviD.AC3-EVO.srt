I've heard much worse.

11
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,400
Two years on the front line.

12
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,320
Language.

13
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,240
At first,
I couldn't stomach it.

14
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,720
But then I thought--

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
They're just words.

16
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,520
Exactly.

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,080
They really don't
mean anything.

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,480
It's actions that matter,
that's what we're judged on.

19
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,840
Don't you agree?

20
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,840
Not everyone can be saved.

21
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,000
We can industrialize
the murder of half

22
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,560
the civilized world, but try
making a decent golf ball.

23
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
It's more complicated
than murder.

24
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,840
Hmm.

25
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,800
That's rich coming
from you, Mrs. Christie.

26
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,440
The reason I'm here--

27
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,760
I hate talking
shop on the fairway.

28
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,080
Let's play a few holes.

29
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,480
I hate golf.

30
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,240
Then what are you
doing at a golf course?

31
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,400
Trying to talk
to you, Sir Arthur.

32
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,960
I need help, with my writing.

33
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,640
Well, I'm not going
to talk unless you play.

34
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,000
Assuming you can,
of course.

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,960
Yes.

36
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,160
My husband loves golf.

37
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,200
That detective,
your Flemish dandy.

38
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,360
You learn to despise him.

39
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,080
Likewise, your readers.

40
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,120
They'll think your
creation is theirs.

41
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,200
If I can't write anymore,
none of that will matter.

42
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,120
Well, it's probably
for the best.

43
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,840
I'd be far happier if
I never started again.

44
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,920
You'd be much poorer.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,200
Yes.

46
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,720
And everyone would hate you.

47
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
That's true.

48
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,040
What if Sherlock
Holmes had never existed?

49
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,480
Hmm.

50
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,080
Good riddance to
an intolerable dick.

51
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,000
Ah!

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,040
But it's not a character
I'm talking about, it's me.

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
All right.

54
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,600
What's the problem?

55
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,360
Why can't you write?

56
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,520
People are solving my murders.

57
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,040
Yes?

58
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,800
They're assuming it's
the most unlikely candidate

59
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
and guessing correctly.

60
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,120
And?

61
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,520
Well, what would be the
point in reading 300 pages

62
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,520
of clever insight and
deduction if the audience

63
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,280
knew who the killer
was in the first five?

64
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,200
Ah!

65
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,560
Clever
bastards, aren't they,

66
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,760
your readers.

67
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm not sure that
guesswork is clever.

68
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,120
You spend months and months
plotting and sub-plotting.

69
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,200
Layering subterfuge
and sowing misdirection

70
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,080
and the buggers find a shortcut

71
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,840
and chop you off
at the knees, hmm?

72
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,560
Exactly!

73
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,760
But what do I do?

74
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,520
I'd stop writing.

75
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,880
I've only just started.

76
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,840
I've never told anyone.

77
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,160
But I dared to
start writing again.

78
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,440
If you tell anyone,
I'll deny it

79
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,640
and I'll make sure your name is
thoroughly dragged through the mud.

80
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,960
I understand.

81
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,960
You're not gonna like it.

82
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,760
At this stage,
I'd do anything.

83
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,600
Design a golf course.

84
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,600
That's what I did.

85
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,760
It was like channeling
the hand of God.

86
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,000
You said an hour,
it's been two.

87
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,560
The writing's
gonna have to wait.

88
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,680
How can I make
this fly properly?

89
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,000
I must have an answer.
I can't wait any longer.

90
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
Can we talk
about this later?

91
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,600
There's nothing
to talk about.

92
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,920
I want a divorce.

93
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
I just need you to agree.

94
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,480
Well, I won't.

95
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,840
Nancy and I...

96
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
You know how sorry we are.

97
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,840
But the quicker this is done,
the less pain for everyone.

98
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,880
Nancy is suffering too.

99
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,200
Yes, Carlo,
everything all right?

100
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,159
There's a lady to see you.

101
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,680
Who is it?
I've no appointments.

102
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,080
A Miss Rogers.

103
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,360
She says it's important.

104
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Since when did I
receive fans at home?

105
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,800
She's a nurse.

106
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,400
She can come
back another time.

107
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,520
It's okay, Carlo,
it's not your fault.

108
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
Why don't you see
what she wants?

109
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,120
If it's anything that can
wait, I'll send her on her way.

110
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,680
God, I hate you.

111
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,040
Then give me a bloody divorce.

112
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,400
- No!
- Why not?

113
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,640
Because I love you.

114
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,240
But I don't love you.

115
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
I know.

116
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,040
This is Miss Rogers.

117
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,720
Hello, Mrs. Christie.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,520
Is this a professional visit?

119
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
I don't remember any
medical appointments.

120
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,040
No, no, nothing like that.

121
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,600
Then why are you here?

122
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,920
I need your assistance.

123
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,560
How so?

124
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,040
I want you to help
me solve a murder.

125
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,400
What?

126
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,640
Six years ago, my friend was
bludgeoned to death on a train.

127
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,280
They never caught the killer

128
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,960
and I've been
investigating ever since.

129
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,600
I'm sure you know
the case. It was famous.

130
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,400
She was called Florence.

131
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,640
She was Nurse
Nightingale's god-daughter.

132
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,600
I'm sorry, Miss Rogers,
but whatever fantasy

133
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,960
you've been indulging, I'm
a writer, not a detective.

134
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,520
Let me just
outline the details.

135
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,880
It's a mystery, like
one of your books.

136
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,200
No doubt, Miss
Rogers, but still,

137
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
there are a hundred
reasons why I can't.

138
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,080
Please could you
see Miss Rogers out,

139
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,480
I must return to my work.

140
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,160
Please! I've nowhere else to turn.
She deserves justice.

141
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,320
Miss Rogers insisted
on leaving this.

142
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,520
I tried to...

143
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,000
Thank you.

144
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,920
You'll
find a way through.

145
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,400
I'm not sure that I will.

146
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,240
Shall I type the manuscript?

147
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,240
Seeing it printed
always helps you.

148
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
No, not this time.

149
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,320
A read through perhaps?

150
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,400
A field trip?

151
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,320
I'll do anything to help.

152
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,560
I know and I'm very grateful.

153
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,560
But I think I need to
see a professional.

154
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,240
Mrs. Christie?

155
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,800
Sir Hugh will see you know.

156
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,080
Thank you.

157
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Mrs. Christie.

158
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,800
I am flattered you should turn
to me for research purposes.

159
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,200
So many writers ride roughshod
over their source material.

160
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,840
I'm very keen to understand

161
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
the emotional dynamics
of course design.

162
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,120
- You mean--
- Thank you.

163
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,680
How one would go about murdering
someone on a golf course.

164
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,800
No, what makes one enjoy
playing a round of golf?

165
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,120
As an alibi.

166
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,960
How could one be playing
golf, but not playing golf.

167
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,560
No, this has nothing
to do with my writing.

168
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,440
I want to design a golf course.

169
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,840
I see.

170
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,400
- Really?
- Yes.

171
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,040
Well, in that case,

172
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,280
I'm afraid my
answer's quite short.

173
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,640
You can't.

174
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,200
Excuse me?

175
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,440
There isn't a golf club I know

176
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,760
that would commission
a design from a woman.

177
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,720
I understand there has
been a trend of late

178
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,280
for ladies to golf.

179
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,560
But really, the sheer
complexity of a designer's task

180
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,680
is beyond the
capabilities of a woman,

181
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,400
no matter how capable
that woman is.

182
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,800
I see.

183
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,640
I hadn't realized.

184
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,480
But thinking about it. How
could I have been so stupid?

185
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,880
Imagine a woman being
able to design the preamble

186
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,880
to putting something
small in a hole.

187
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,280
A woman might just present the
hole and have done,

188
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,160
and where would be the
fun in that.

189
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,440
There'd be nothing
to groom for a start.

190
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,000
But thank you for your time.

191
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,640
It's been pointless.

192
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,120
Mommy, will you
play hide-and-seek?

193
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,480
Yes, dear.

194
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,240
What are you doing?

195
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,080
Working.

196
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,440
That's not work.

197
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,240
Where's Carlo?

198
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,440
She's hiding.

199
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,120
Shouldn't you find her?

200
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,280
How long will she hide for?

201
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,520
I imagine
until you find her.

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,720
But what if I don't find her?

203
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,800
She'll starve.

204
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,480
Really?

205
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Carlo.

206
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,960
Rosalind.

207
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,960
I'm coming.

208
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,160
Ready or not.

209
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,800
"And who is to
blame for all this?

210
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,040
Nobody is to blame
except the robots.

211
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,520
No, we are to blame,
for our own selfish ends

212
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,400
for profit, for progress.

213
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,440
We have destroyed mankind."

214
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,480
Miss Rogers.

215
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,160
Thank you.

216
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,520
You don't know how much this means.
Come in.

217
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,240
I haven't done anything yet.

218
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,600
But you're here.

219
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,840
You're going to help.

220
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,800
I have some questions.

221
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,240
Oh, of course, anything.

222
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,200
Come through.

223
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,520
I think her cousin killed her.

224
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,000
He's called Randolph.

225
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,319
He inherited the trust fund.

226
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
At first, I thought it
might be her brother,

227
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,880
but he was in
America at the time.

228
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,680
He took back the pendant
Florence gave me.

229
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Randolph hates me.

230
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,160
Florence says so in her diaries.
I'll show you.

231
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,400
You have her diaries?

232
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,319
Of course.

233
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,680
He'd never even met me.

234
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,680
Um...

235
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,960
Zaki Hanachi, one of
Florence's waifs and strays.

236
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,800
He came to see her two weeks
before she was murdered.

237
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,120
He wouldn't leave her alone.

238
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,560
He wanted money, I'm sure.

239
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,240
- Florence had money?
- Oh, yes.

240
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,360
The police thought it
was a robbery gone wrong.

241
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,600
There was a boxer,
but really he's a thief.

242
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,920
Travis Pickford.

243
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
Nasty piece of work.

244
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,880
He was arrested, but they
said he didn't do it.

245
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,240
His gun was covered in blood.

246
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,680
And then there's
the nurse, Daphne.

247
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,480
Florence's report would have
seen her barred from nursing.

248
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
That boy would have died.

249
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,040
It has to be one of them.

250
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,080
I just
don't know which one.

251
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,280
Mabel.

252
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
Yes.

253
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,720
Is that Florence?

254
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Yes.

255
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,520
Yes, it is.

256
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,600
Look, I know
how this must look.

257
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,640
You were right, what you
said when I came to see you.

258
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,840
This is a fantasy.

259
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,480
But you've got to believe me.

260
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,680
Florence wasn't
killed by a stranger,

261
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,880
she was murdered for a reason.

262
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,680
Let's start at the beginning.

263
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,960
Florence always
took a corner seat

264
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
in the last carriage
facing forwards.

265
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,840
She didn't like trains.

266
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,400
A friend of hers died in
Italy, suffocated in a tunnel.

267
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,160
Bad coal, I think.

268
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,080
The day she was attacked,
I found her a seat

269
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,400
in the compartment next
door, but a woman told us

270
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,920
it was taken, so
we came in here.

271
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
What woman?

272
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,960
I don't remember.

273
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,680
And the man in the brown suit?

274
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,400
He got on just
before the train left.

275
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,880
But I don't remember his face.

276
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,080
The police were convinced
he was the killer.

277
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,320
If only I could give
them a description.

278
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,760
You're sure it was a man?

279
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,680
Yes.

280
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,680
I mean,
he looked like a man.

281
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,440
Did Florence recognize him?

282
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,120
God, I can't remember.

283
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,920
You must try.

284
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,280
Murdering someone is easier
if you know their routine.

285
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,600
Who knew about
Florence's train habits?

286
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,360
Oh, everyone.

287
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,480
I mean, she wasn't
embarrassed about her fears.

288
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,040
She'd always make a
point of explaining it.

289
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,120
Florence didn't believe in pretending
to be something she wasn't.

290
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,920
This is the tunnel
where it happened.

291
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,320
That's what the
police thought.

292
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,200
Seems harder to kill someone

293
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,880
when you can't see
them very well.

294
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,520
It took her four days to die.

295
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,680
Bits of skull
stuck in her brain.

296
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,200
Everyone saying it was all right
that she didn't feel anything.

297
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,320
But I'd seen it too many times
before with the soldiers.

298
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,240
The mind finds a way through.

299
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,800
She knew that she was broken,
she knew that she was dying,

300
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
but she also knew
that I was there.

301
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,400
And that I loved her.

302
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,400
How long were you together?

303
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,480
Twenty-six years.

304
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,920
That's 15 more
than Archie and I.

305
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,040
I'm very sorry.

306
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,040
This is where the
person in her carriage got off.

307
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,080
The man in the brown suit?

308
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,920
Yes, but witnesses
described someone else.

309
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,960
Heavier built and
different clothes.

310
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,800
And the man you saw
getting in the compartment

311
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,200
with Florence had
nothing with him.

312
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,040
He couldn't have been
concealing a disguise?

313
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,480
It was a cold day, but
he had no coat or bag.

314
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,000
I remember that.

315
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,760
So, one man got in the
compartment with Florence

316
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,960
and another man got out.

317
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,680
Yes, that's right.

318
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,800
Impossible.

319
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,240
Who was Florence visiting?

320
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,560
Mrs. Pamela Rose.

321
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,960
Her son James died in France

322
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,680
and Florence tended to him.

323
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,800
What happened?

324
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,040
Ah, he was shot after
armistice by some madman

325
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,720
who should've been in
front of a firing squad.

326
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,720
Could she have blamed
Florence for not saving him?

327
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,880
Oh, no, he was dying by
the time he got to Florence.

328
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,000
All she could do was
make him comfortable.

329
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,560
Had you met Mrs. Rose?

330
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,800
This would've been
their first meeting.

331
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,640
She'd only just discovered that
Florence had helped her son.

332
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
She wanted to hear
about his last few days.

333
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,240
So she knew the
train Florence was on.

334
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,440
Oh, she was to collect
her from the station.

335
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,200
But you can't think--

336
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,400
She's a suspect.

337
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,840
Same is true for anyone who
knew what train she was on.

338
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,000
So, that makes five.

339
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Well, unless you count me.

340
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,320
Don't worry, I'm not
going to berate you.

341
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,400
I think it's time for a truce.

342
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,480
You do?

343
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,000
This is a course
I'd like to play.

344
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,200
Where did you get this?

345
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,120
I made it.

346
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,920
Bollocks!
You hate golf.

347
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I hate playing it.

348
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,080
I don't understand.

349
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,040
I enjoyed
the challenge.

350
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,640
You made this for me.

351
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,000
No, I didn't.

352
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,200
You're a terrible liar.

353
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,560
But look, I was supposed to be
going to a Suicide Club reunion.

354
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,880
Why don't I forego an evening

355
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,560
of exaggerated flying
heroics and stay here?

356
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,560
We can look at this together.

357
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,960
I've already seen a couple
of small improvements.

358
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,440
With a bit of work, we could
make this something special.

359
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,280
You really like it?

360
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,280
Yes, it's fabulous.

361
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,840
That means a lot.

362
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,480
But I really must be
getting back to my work.

363
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,360
Anything else, Mrs. Christie?

364
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,280
No, thank you, that's lovely.

365
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
I haven't seen
Florence in years.

366
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
How is she?

367
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,600
She died, I'm afraid.

368
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,640
Oh, that's terrible.

369
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,120
I'm surprised Mr. and Mrs.
Williams didn't tell me about it.

370
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,000
But then again,
maybe they did.

371
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,880
My memory's not what it was.

372
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,800
I'm borrowing the house
for a sort of memorial.

373
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,360
They were very
fond of Florence.

374
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,400
Florence was the only
good person I ever met.

375
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
Mmm-hmm.

376
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,520
It's been a while
since the family

377
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,320
have been in the country.

378
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,360
I'm afraid I'm finding it
harder to keep on top of it.

379
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,600
Hmm.

380
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,000
I hope your guests don't
mind a bit of mess.

381
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,120
Oh, dear.

382
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,640
I must have forgotten
to get this cleared.

383
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,120
Don't you worry, miss,
I'll get right on it.

384
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,840
You won't forget to collect
our guests from the station.

385
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,200
All the important
things gets written down.

386
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,760
Rosalind, dear.

387
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,120
Rosalind?

388
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,200
I'm going away
for a little bit.

389
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,480
I need to solve a murder.

390
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,920
I have to pretend
to be someone else.

391
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,480
What color is a bunker?

392
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,680
Yellow.

393
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,120
Carlo will take you
to see your father.

394
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,760
Will Nancy be there?

395
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,280
I expect so.

396
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,840
Nancy's pretty.

397
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,280
My great-aunt told me

398
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,640
it's better to be
pretty than clever.

399
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,240
Was she pretty?

400
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,640
She was clever.

401
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,760
Can I meet her?

402
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,200
She died.

403
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,600
Long time ago.

404
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
It's better to be
alive, than dead.

405
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,200
That's right.

406
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,560
Do you have a
disguise, can I see it?

407
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,440
When I get back.

408
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,560
Are you going somewhere?

409
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,280
When I finish this, I'm
going to draw a picture of me

410
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,960
so you always know where I am.

411
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,040
Here you go,
Mrs. Westmacott.

412
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,120
Thank you.

413
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,440
Is there anything else?

414
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,880
Some stamps perhaps?

415
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,680
Is it true there's a writer of
detective novels who lives nearby?

416
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,240
Yes, Mrs. Christie.

417
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,680
She's famous.

418
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,120
Are her novels any good?

419
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,560
Not as good as Stevenson,
but better than Conan-Doyle.

420
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,520
Thank you.

421
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,960
Florence here
will look after ya.

422
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,000
I was beginning to think
you changed your mind.

423
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,360
What a terrible journey!

424
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,920
The car broke,
the train got stuck.

425
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,360
I spent last night in what
I think was a brothel.

426
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,480
Are they here?

427
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,240
Yes, and they started
to talk to one another.

428
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,760
I'm terrified they'll
make a connection.

429
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,800
Well then, better get to it.
Any surprises?

430
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,520
Miss Miller has brought
her father with her,

431
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,200
or should I say,
he's decided to come.

432
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,280
I don't think his
motivation is paternal.

433
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,040
Mrs. Rose is with
her son Franklin.

434
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,360
I get the impression he's not
completely taken in by our lies.

435
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,280
Mr. Hanachi is so nervous,
I'm wondering if it's an act.

436
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,880
And Mr. Pickford looks capable
of just about anything.

437
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,040
Any other surprises?

438
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,320
Their luggage is missing.

439
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,000
- Oh, and...
- What?

440
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,200
What is it?

441
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,240
Oh, God.

442
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,400
I'm not missing, I've
only been gone 48 hours.

443
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,680
We'll have to try and keep our
suspects away from the newspapers.

444
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,320
At least there
isn't a picture.

445
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,560
Mrs. Westmacott?

446
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,120
Assuming you are
Mrs. Westmacott.

447
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,320
Yes, that's correct.

448
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,200
I must apologize for the delay.

449
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
I'm sure you all have
a lot of questions.

450
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,880
Why are we
being kept in the dark?

451
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,920
Are you the secretary?

452
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,800
- When do we get our money?
- Who's in charge?

453
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,960
Where's the lawyer?

454
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,720
Good morning.

455
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,600
My name is Mary Westmacott.

456
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,400
I am the representative of
Messieurs Kant, Hope, Delaney.

457
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,840
We thought you might
want to change that

458
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,960
to "Can't Help Delay
Me."

459
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,480
Firstly, I would like to reinforce what
was stated in the letters you were sent.

460
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,360
No one is under any
compulsion to stay.

461
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,680
Our firm has no legal
power or responsibility

462
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,080
other than that conferred on us

463
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,960
as executors of
Mr. Dower's will.

464
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,000
Mr. Dower's legacy is
valued at £186,000.

465
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,080
This total, minus our
fees, is to be distributed

466
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,040
proportionately amongst
you, his relatives.

467
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,520
Tracing Mr. Dower's bloodline
has been very difficult.

468
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,840
The purpose of calling
you here is twofold.

469
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,880
To check our findings
regarding your lineage,

470
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,640
and to satisfy a couple of
specific conditions of the will.

471
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,760
We weren't told
about any conditions.

472
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,680
No, these are matters
to be discussed privately.

473
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,320
There is a good deal of work
to be done and I have no wish

474
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,680
to increase your fees
through wasted time.

475
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,560
If anyone is unhappy
with these arrangements

476
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,080
or feels they no longer wish
to engage in this process,

477
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,600
now is the time to let me know.

478
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,560
Given my late arrival,

479
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,480
I won't start formal
interviews until the morning.

480
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,320
Prior to that, are
there any questions

481
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,040
which require an
immediate answer?

482
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,760
Yes?

483
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,040
Do you know where
my suitcase is?

484
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,480
No, Mr. Hanachi, luggage
is not my responsibility.

485
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,000
It's like Christmas
with the family.

486
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,880
Only without anything to drink.

487
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,280
Entrapped in a festive morgue.

488
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,520
You know what? You're
absolutely right, we are family.

489
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,200
We're related.

490
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,280
Yeah, well, go
back far enough,

491
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,560
I'm related to the king.

492
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,720
Or a shoe shiner.

493
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,720
Mr. Hanachi, would
I be right in thinking

494
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,080
you served in the war?

495
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,600
How did you know?

496
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,800
My other son fought at Verdun.

497
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,680
Are you Algerian
or perhaps Moroccan?

498
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,719
I'm French.

499
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,239
Born in Constantine.

500
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,280
Your English is excellent.

501
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,760
I was a translator.

502
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,800
Oh.

503
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,840
As I remember it,
howitzer sounds

504
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,280
the same in English as in French.

505
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,440
You fought?

506
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,800
No, I was a chaplain.

507
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,840
Ha! I knew it.

508
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,080
I had the feeling we were
in the presence of God

509
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,440
ever since I got here.

510
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,120
How funny to think
we're all related.

511
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,840
I hardly know anyone
on my mother's side.

512
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,760
When she died, there was
just her half-sister.

513
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Imagine all this family
I never knew I had.

514
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,480
How did you track us all down?

515
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,360
It was done by
a specialist firm.

516
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,679
With a pin in a toy phone
book by the looks of it.

517
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,560
Do feel free
to take your leave.

518
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,320
A quarter share is preferable.

519
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,280
My daughter will get hers.

520
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,840
Your letter stated that Mr. Dower
spent most of his life in America.

521
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,360
What was his line of work?

522
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,920
He sold cars.

523
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,080
All that money from cars.

524
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,200
I'm in the wrong business.

525
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,040
What is your
business, Mr. Pickford?

526
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,160
Removals.

527
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,160
Little like you, Reverend.

528
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
I no longer serve.

529
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,920
- God or country?
- Both.

530
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,120
Shame, I could've
used your help.

531
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,240
What happened to
change your mind?

532
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,520
I stopped believing in either.

533
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,680
Surely you don't mean that?

534
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,960
What did you do
during the war?

535
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,480
Administration.

536
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,640
Mmm-hmm.

537
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,440
You never saw the trenches.

538
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,160
I read a great
deal concerning them.

539
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,080
A million crimes
enabled by my country

540
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,560
unpunished by my God.

541
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,440
Ah, any sign of our trunks?

542
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,960
Yes, sir, I'm afraid they
went back to the station,

543
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,160
but they'll be with you
again in the morning.

544
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,640
Well, I suppose I should
thank God for that.

545
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,320
What time do the
interviews start in the morning?

546
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
10:00 a.m.

547
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,920
Perhaps you and your daughter
would like to go first?

548
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,360
Yes.

549
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,400
How much of our inheritance
is locked in this pile?

550
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,680
None of it.

551
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,600
Mr. Dower's gift to his
relatives is a cash asset.

552
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,200
And a good job too.

553
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,680
This castle's built of paper.

554
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,520
Spent last night listening
to the Frenchman snore.

555
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,880
So, we're not inheriting
the whole estate.

556
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,240
No. The bulk of it
is being handled

557
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,520
by Mr. Dower's American
representatives.

558
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,320
I thought that
might be the case.

559
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,080
There's a great deal
more at stake here

560
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,080
than a couple of hundred
thousand, isn't there?

561
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,040
When all's said and done, we
might be due a bigger share.

562
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,880
A much bigger share.

563
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,040
We're safe, they're
in their rooms.

564
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,400
Oh, that greedy bastard.

565
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,920
He's already got the trust
he inherited from Florence.

566
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,920
Imagine being offered
all that money

567
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,440
and his first thought
is to want more.

568
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,880
It doesn't make him a killer.

569
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,880
He's watching us.

570
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,440
- I know.
- He's no fool.

571
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,200
Money makes most
people foolish.

572
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,080
Wade's a bastard too.

573
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,360
Mr. Hanachi
certainly thinks so.

574
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,720
His poor daughter.

575
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,000
Imagine living
with such a brute.

576
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,160
His poor daughter is
one of our suspects.

577
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,800
Pamela seems nice.

578
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,000
Maybe she did it.

579
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,840
How you going to
conduct the interviews?

580
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,480
By keeping their minds
on the inheritance.

581
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,760
What did you find
in their luggage?

582
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,800
Hmm, come with me.

583
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,920
So, um, Wade has a cleaning kit
for a pistol, but no pistol.

584
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,840
Daphne has enough
make-up to put on a show.

585
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,400
Uh, Pamela and Franklin's
cases are unremarkable.

586
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,760
Couple of books,
copy of the Bible.

587
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,640
Zaki's case has a few
clothes and a tin of coffee.

588
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,160
Uh, Travis has a doctor's
case which is empty.

589
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,080
And Randolph?

590
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,720
Smut.

591
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,520
And not the artistic kind.

592
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,920
Could Florence really
have ended Daphne's career?

593
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,640
Oh, yes. Her report would have
seen Daphne barred from nursing,

594
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,400
but she was killed before
she could write it.

595
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,040
But that girl's scared
of her own shadow.

596
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,000
Imagine Daphne
killing in cold blood.

597
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,920
- Will this take long?
- I hope not.

598
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,640
Your mother's maiden
name was Stone.

599
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,360
She died on June 24th, 1922.

600
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,680
You already know that.

601
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,440
Do you have
the death certificate?

602
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,920
Everything is exactly as
stated in my daughter's letter.

603
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,360
Your mother's father, Joshua
Stone, lived in Richmond.

604
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,760
Her grandfather, William
Stone, died in Aberdeen.

605
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,280
I don't see how
this is going--

606
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,480
The man found in our
searches was James Stone,

607
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,760
not William Stone.
It's a different person.

608
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,520
Well, clearly there's
been a mistake.

609
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,320
William was probably
a middle name.

610
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,000
It was definitely William.

611
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,880
My mother used to tell
me stories about him.

612
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,480
He was a cavalry trooper,
he fought at Waterloo.

613
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,160
Well, you can't take
my wife's word for it.

614
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,640
She was a drunk.

615
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,160
If I remember correctly, his
name was James William Stone.

616
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,480
Yes, that's it.

617
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,440
Well, that would
be unfortunate.

618
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,600
Why?

619
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,160
Because I've
discovered a mistake.

620
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,360
James Stone was the half-brother of
Mr. Dower's great uncle, Andrew Dower.

621
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,560
William Stone was
a second cousin.

622
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,560
If Daphne is correct that
her great-grandfather

623
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,440
is William Stone, she is the only
surviving direct descendant of Mr. Dower.

624
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,320
I'll have to check no similar mistake has
been made in regards his other relatives,

625
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,160
but if I might, Daphne
would inherit the majority

626
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,760
of Mr. Dower's estate with
a much smaller proportion

627
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,600
going to his
other antecedents.

628
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,040
Daphne's bound to be right.

629
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,520
She always is.

630
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,840
I'm no good with these things.

631
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,720
Once removed, twice removed.

632
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,200
It's all Greek to me.

633
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,920
However, before
we can progress,

634
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,600
there's something
I need to establish.

635
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,400
Of course. Anything.

636
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,600
You finished your nurses
training in February 1920.

637
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,720
Yes.

638
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,880
Shortly after completing it,

639
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,920
you went in front of the
regional superintendent.

640
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,760
They were looking into a
complaint serious enough

641
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,200
to have you removed
as a Queen's nurse.

642
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,000
What in God's name has
that got to do with this?

643
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,320
As I said yesterday, there are certain
conditions of the will that must be met.

644
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,880
She was exonerated.

645
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,480
No evidence against her.

646
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,960
Just unfounded allegations
by a bull dagger,

647
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,200
who got what she deserved.

648
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,640
Look, I don't mean to
fly off the handle.

649
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,320
It's just, it was a very
unpleasant time for my daughter.

650
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,320
That woman almost
ruined her life.

651
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,240
Miss Miller?

652
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,080
I was cleared.

653
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,840
And the
allegations were incorrect?

654
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,760
Yes.

655
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,920
Then I have everything
I need to proceed.

656
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,840
I'll explain the
situation to the others.

657
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,120
Thank you.

658
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,520
Come on, darling.

659
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,280
Is there
something else?

660
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,960
There's a line
of people outside

661
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,920
who'll be none too pleased
about the turn of events.

662
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,960
Let's not waste
any more of their time.

663
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,920
Mrs. Westmacott, who do
you want to talk to next?

664
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,240
I'm afraid there's been
a change of circumstances.

665
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,680
What does that mean?

666
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,320
And why are you grinning
like a Cheshire cat?

667
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,720
What does that man got
to be so happy about?

668
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,960
As I understand it,
he's not even a relative.

669
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,680
Not of yours, thank God.

670
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,800
We're related where it counts.

671
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,080
What's he talking about?

672
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,440
You told them most of the
money's going to Daphne!

673
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,680
What if they just leave?

674
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,080
They were angry, but some
money is better than no money.

675
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,800
But I don't understand.
I mean, why take such a risk?

676
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,680
Because Wade killed Florence.

677
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,040
You think he killed her to
save his daughter's career?

678
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,400
But there's no evidence.

679
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,520
We'll find it.

680
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,920
It's ironic. I can't
write at the moment

681
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,160
because I'm so worried about
always making my murderer

682
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,760
the most unlikely suspect.

683
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,120
Talk about unlikely, Wade
wasn't even supposed to be here.

684
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,440
But there's no connection to
any other aspect of the murder.

685
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,200
We just need to keep digging.

686
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,040
There must be something here
that links him to the crime.

687
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,040
See if you can find it.

688
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,600
I'm going to talk to him again.

689
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,800
He'll help us if he thinks
it's going to make him rich.

690
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,880
What if you're wrong?

691
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,440
I'm not.

692
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,480
But we have to find the proof
before we can set a trap.

693
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,720
You looking for someone?

694
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,960
Mr. Miller.

695
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,360
Last I saw,
he was on the terrace.

696
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,720
Uh, who represents Mr. Dower
in the United States?

697
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,040
Was that a gunshot?

698
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,760
Gunshots don't
sound like that.

699
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,520
Travis probably
found some champagne.

700
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,640
I'm afraid I have some
rather pressing business.

701
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,760
It's Wade.

702
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,000
Someone tried to kill Daphne.

703
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,400
How?

704
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,840
Daphne said she
was in her room.

705
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,840
The door opened and a
pistol was pointed at her.

706
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,320
Wade jumped in
front of the bullet,

707
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,520
stumbled backwards and
fell through the window.

708
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,480
Turns out that deeply unpleasant
man was a bit of a hero.

709
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,720
Has anyone checked
for signs of life?

710
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,240
He looks like all the
other dead people I've seen.

711
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,440
Are you a nurse?

712
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,840
Oh, no, I used to
work in a hospital.

713
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,680
You're right, he's dead.

714
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,760
I think.

715
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,720
It must have been a big gun.

716
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,360
I'll call the police.

717
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,520
Where's Travis?

718
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,480
I wouldn't put it past
him to kill someone

719
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,960
for a bigger share of the pot.

720
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,280
Mabel, when you get back,
could you help Daphne?

721
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,280
She has a nasty
cut from the glass.

722
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,320
Yeah.

723
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,520
Poor man was trying
to get dressed.

724
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,920
Bit of food will do you good.

725
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,680
Believe me, I know.

726
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,160
Thank you.

727
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,520
I couldn't bear
to be on my own.

728
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,400
Never talk to the police
on an empty stomach.

729
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Is that so?

730
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,880
Not really.

731
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,280
Never talk to the
police, full stop.

732
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
You take that woman writer
that's topped herself.

733
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,920
If everyone in her books
had kept their mouth shut,

734
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
that Poirot couldn't
catch a cold.

735
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,520
You mean Agatha Christie.

736
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,920
Golden rule,
like my cousin says.

737
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,320
Says what?

738
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,640
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

739
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,720
She's a very good writer.

740
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,880
But rather predictable.

741
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,840
I read the
Murder of Peter Ackroyd,

742
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,600
guessed the end
within a few pages.

743
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,000
It's easy when you know how.

744
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,440
Roger.

745
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,960
Excuse me.

746
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,000
Roger Ackroyd.

747
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,360
I'm pretty sure
it was Peter.

748
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,960
So, how we gonna guess
who knocked off Wade?

749
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,520
No offense, but none of you lot
look like the killing type.

750
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,160
That's how it is
in her books.

751
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,000
The last person
you'd ever suspect.

752
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,400
If Mrs. Christie
were writing this,

753
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,480
Mrs. Westmacott
would be guilty.

754
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,360
More like that
caretaker, Mr. Todd.

755
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,120
Police can talk to him all they like.
He'll have forgotten he did it.

756
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,520
Murder isn't like
a detective novel.

757
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,640
Of course.

758
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,960
Sorry.

759
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,240
Your father was a brave man.

760
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,600
He had his faults.

761
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,080
But after my mother died, he
came home to look after me.

762
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,520
He was abroad.

763
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,560
In New York, left in June '16.

764
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,200
I didn't see him for six years.

765
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,080
So many of my friends lost
their fathers in the war,

766
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,440
I suppose
I should be grateful

767
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,080
for the years that I had.

768
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,000
Someone tried
to kill Miss Miller.

769
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,800
Until the police get here,

770
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,640
I will keep watch
outside her room.

771
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,920
Oh, very brave.

772
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,480
You sure you're French?

773
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,360
It's very kind, Mr. Hanachi.

774
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,880
Our room is next door.

775
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,640
Franklin and I will be
sure to look after you.

776
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,840
It will be reassuring

777
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,480
to have a man who
served to keep watch.

778
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,080
I served my country.

779
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,280
Served them sugar,
meat, cigarettes.

780
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,960
Much more of a
service than donating

781
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,840
my bollocks to
French agriculture.

782
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,920
The police will
be here shortly.

783
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,520
I've been asked to request
that no one leaves.

784
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,240
Even if I did kill him,

785
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,360
I'm not leaving
till I get my money.

786
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,360
I said I was cleaning.
We don't have long.

787
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,040
It couldn't have been Wade.
He was in New York.

788
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,640
We got an innocent man killed.

789
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,120
I don't think he was innocent.

790
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,360
That's hardly the point.
They were our lies.

791
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,600
But someone else's bullet.

792
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,600
That doesn't make
any difference.

793
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,720
I know what it's
like to kill by proxy.

794
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,320
This isn't it.

795
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,960
During the war, Florence and I
worked at the clearing stations.

796
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,800
It's where the
wounded are assessed.

797
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,360
Who can wait, who is critical,
who it was pointless to help.

798
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,400
I was good at it.

799
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,240
I never dwelled on the hundreds
of people I sent to die.

800
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,280
Florence wanted
to save everyone.

801
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,640
She was a remarkable
woman, wasn't she?

802
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,400
Mmm.

803
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,240
Towards the end of the war,
a German called Keller

804
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,560
came in with a treatable wound.

805
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,080
I was told he'd done something
awful and should be left to rot.

806
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,640
When Florence found out,
she threatened to contact

807
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,400
headquarters and then
treated him herself.

808
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,080
She was better than me.

809
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,040
We can't give up.

810
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,680
The police are coming.

811
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,640
They'll see through this
charade in a few hours.

812
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,600
Then we don't have long.

813
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,240
I was wrong about Wade.

814
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,920
That doesn't mean we're
wrong about everything.

815
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,680
I was thinking about my
writing, not the evidence.

816
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,840
Well, what evidence?

817
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,640
We've got to continue
the interviews.

818
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,720
Whilst they still believe in the
inheritance, we've still got a chance.

819
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,720
How?

820
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,880
I... I think I know
who killed Wade.

821
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Who?

822
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,760
I'm not making the
same mistake twice.

823
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,440
But if I'm right about Wade,

824
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,960
Florence's killer can be
found in the same way.

825
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,840
We can still solve this.

826
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,320
What are you doing?

827
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,440
I had some work for Miss Rogers.
What are you doing?

828
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,600
The police are here.

829
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,800
So you all received the same
invitation from Miss Westmacott?

830
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,360
Yes, she's the
one in the glasses.

831
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,440
And you all arrived
at the house at the same time?

832
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,360
Yes.

833
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,680
You certain about that?

834
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,680
Now that you're all here,
I will introduce myself.

835
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,000
My name is Detective
Inspector Dicks.

836
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,040
This is PC Spencer.

837
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,400
I'd rather not shout.

838
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,840
As you may know, the author
Agatha Christie has gone missing.

839
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,040
There are currently 5,000 police
personnel searching for her,

840
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,720
and as a consequence, my usual
compliment of 13 officers

841
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,720
is running at three, myself
and PC Spencer included.

842
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,080
So because of Mrs. Christie,

843
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,800
I do not have enough officers
to take you to the station,

844
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,000
so I'm forced to
question you here.

845
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,280
We'll start with your
personal details.

846
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,440
These will be
thoroughly checked.

847
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,440
Any false information
will get you arrested,

848
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,120
which, to be honest, will
make my job a little easier.

849
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,640
Accommodating you in the
cells is not a problem.

850
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,640
Although, I would
rather be here

851
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,600
than searching for
authors in bushes,

852
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,400
I do not like working with
one hand tied behind my back.

853
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,280
This process will
take some time,

854
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,320
but please do not keep
asking me how long.

855
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,520
The more annoying you are,
the more of a bastard I'll be.

856
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,360
And please, do not even
think of asking to leave.

857
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,720
Now, Mrs. Westmacott,

858
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,560
I've been told that you
are the person responsible

859
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,960
for bringing everybody here,
so I'll start with you.

860
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,120
Follow me please.

861
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,280
Now, if you don't mind.

862
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,840
Name?

863
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,360
Mary Westmacott.

864
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,480
Date of birth?

865
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,840
September 1st, 1890.

866
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,080
Occupation?

867
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,360
Legal representative.

868
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,520
Employer?

869
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,720
Kant, Hope, Delaney,
26 York Street, W1.

870
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,000
Telephone number?

871
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,560
Mine or theirs?

872
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,160
What would be the point
in having your number?

873
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,800
I'm trying to verify this ridiculous
story I've just been told.

874
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,320
You always this rude?

875
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,280
Yes.

876
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,600
I'm fully aware of my rights.

877
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,120
Well, that makes one of us.

878
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,880
Are you going to
answer the question?

879
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,000
My office number is London
7-7-3-4.

880
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,400
The secretary's name
is Miss Fisher.

881
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,880
She'll confirm everything.

882
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,720
That'll do?

883
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,200
Am I allowed to
continue my work?

884
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,720
Does your work involve
undermining my investigation?

885
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,520
- Course not.
- Then do what you like.

886
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,120
Thank you, I will.

887
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,160
DI Dicks, what a charmer.

888
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,160
Do hope you're gonna
be a bit more gentle.

889
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,520
Do you have the documents?

890
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,040
Lawyer, goes to the dentist.

891
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,000
When he comes round from
the ether, it's dark.

892
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,720
He asks the nurse,
"What's going on?"

893
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,880
She says, "There's a fire across
the road, so we drew the blinds.

894
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,920
Didn't want you to wake
up, think you'd died."

895
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,920
That's very good.

896
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,720
Ah, maybe you're not
such a scratch after all.

897
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,720
You were arrested for
murder in January 1920.

898
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,920
Is that true?

899
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,120
You don't have to
answer my questions,

900
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,560
but it means I can't
do my job,

901
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,480
which means you
won't get your money.

902
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,480
I don't know what
you're talking about.

903
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,160
A nurse called Florence.

904
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,800
She was beaten to death. It
was a highly publicized case.

905
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,080
You've made a mistake.

906
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,480
"No benefit of any kind

907
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,560
can be transferred to an individual
charged with a capital offense."

908
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,600
Well, in that case,
there's no problem.

909
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,880
I was never charged.

910
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,000
But you were arrested.

911
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,600
Sure.

912
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,720
They tried to pin it on me.

913
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,800
You just said you didn't
know anything about it.

914
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,880
Well, what do you expect?

915
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,760
I expect to be told the truth.

916
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,520
As well as the requirements
to confirm identity,

917
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,000
Mr. Dower gave his executors
a discretionary power

918
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,120
with regards to the moral
suitability of his heirs.

919
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,760
I'm suitable, just careful.

920
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,760
But now I don't know if you
are who you say you are.

921
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,920
You've got my papers.

922
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Papers can be forged.

923
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,520
Given the sums
of money involved,

924
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,040
I'm sure you can appreciate
the need for thoroughness.

925
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,680
Fair enough.

926
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,960
Does your firm have any
dealings with Scotland Yard?

927
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,720
Of course.

928
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,680
Ask them why they let me off.

929
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,880
For what purpose?

930
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,240
They'll tell you something
they never told the papers.

931
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,160
The killer left a
footprint in the blood.

932
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,000
And?

933
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,840
And there's no way I could
know this if I wasn't arrested.

934
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,480
Took me all of five
seconds to point out

935
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,280
me feet were three
sizes too big.

936
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,960
They even tried to squeeze
me into an old trench boot

937
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,880
like I was fucking Cinderella.

938
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,120
A trench boot?

939
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,360
Yeah, another thing they
never told the public.

940
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,960
Doesn't look good when
our boys come home

941
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,720
and start murdering civilians.

942
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,760
Well...

943
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,600
Guess that means, I've passed.

944
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,680
I'll need to confirm this.

945
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,000
Hmm, confirm away.

946
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,280
The longer we wait,
the more chance

947
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,920
another member of my
family has an accident.

948
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,680
Say what you like
about the Germans,

949
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,280
they know how to make coffee.

950
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,480
Thank you.

951
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,280
That's the first time I've heard
a Frenchman compliment a German.

952
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,320
After you got over the fact
they were trying to kill you,

953
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,560
most of them are pretty
decent, in my experience.

954
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,680
Your experience
doesn't amount to much.

955
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,000
I lied before.

956
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,360
I'm not really French.

957
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,960
No, you're a bloody traitor.

958
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,960
Come now, dear, we all
have different experiences.

959
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,120
Clearly.

960
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,400
I did not mean to offend.

961
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,000
Mr. Hanachi, could we
speak in private?

962
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,520
I have nothing to hide.

963
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,440
No, but some of the details
of your case are personal.

964
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,960
It does not take
a great detective

965
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,360
to work out my connection
to Mr. Dower is illegitimate.

966
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,800
Unfortunately, my notes
are upstairs.

967
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,000
Okay, I'll come.

968
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,240
But only if Miss Miller
promises to stay here.

969
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,680
I promise.

970
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,400
Don't say another word!

971
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,000
She is a fraud.

972
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,880
Her and that sorry
excuse for a maid.

973
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,080
We've been set up.

974
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,200
What, there's no inheritance?

975
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,920
Ha, that's the least of it.

976
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,040
This whole charade is--

977
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,560
A murder investigation.

978
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,680
Oh, God help me!

979
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,440
- You admit it?
- Of course, I do.

980
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,080
I'm amazed it took you
so long to work it out.

981
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,440
I'm a private detective
hired by Miss Rogers.

982
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,600
You are all suspects in the murder
of Florence Nightingale Shore.

983
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,640
Florence, but--

984
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,080
How dare you!

985
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,200
My beautiful cousin.

986
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,880
What possible reason
could I have for killing her?

987
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,720
The same reason
that brought you here.

988
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,200
Money.

989
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,920
Well!

990
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,840
I suppose that makes
sense of things.

991
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,120
No, it doesn't.

992
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,240
What has this got
to do with me?

993
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,640
She was killed by someone
wearing service boots.

994
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,120
That's ridiculous.

995
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,840
Florence was the only nurse

996
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,680
who looked after us.

997
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,360
She didn't care who we
were or what we'd done.

998
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,040
She was perfect.

999
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,640
- I would never--
- You killed her.

1000
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,920
Now then.

1001
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,960
Now then.

1002
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,520
Murderer or not, Mr. Hanachi
is right about one thing.

1003
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,360
This is ridiculous.

1004
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,880
And a monumental
waste of my time.

1005
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,840
Spencer.

1006
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,440
I've already got one
murder to deal with.

1007
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,880
I couldn't give a rat's
ass about another one.

1008
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,040
When this bloody author's
found, I'm taking you all in.

1009
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,920
In the meantime,
you'll stay in your rooms.

1010
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,880
Anyone ignoring this will be
considered a suspect and arrested.

1011
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,600
That is
completely unacceptable.

1012
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,880
My mother and I have nothing
to do with this absurd game.

1013
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,440
Daphne can attest to our
whereabouts when Wade was killed

1014
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,560
and we never met
that bloody nurse.

1015
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,160
I insist that we be
allowed to leave.

1016
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,920
I'm happy to put you in handcuffs
right now if that's what you want.

1017
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,320
You've had it from the
inspector's point of view.

1018
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,120
This is an
intolerable situation.

1019
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,160
Well, we can agree on that.

1020
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:43,040
Travis and the fake maid,
Miss Rogers, have gone missing.

1021
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,400
PC Spencer will escort
you to your room

1022
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,920
whilst I will amuse myself
playing hide-and-seek.

1023
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,680
I advise you to use
your confinement wisely.

1024
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,880
If any of you has
any information

1025
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,440
about the only murder
that I'm interested in,

1026
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,200
do yourself a favor
and come forward.

1027
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,280
Now is a good time to remember

1028
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,920
that there is a difference
between a cell and the gallows.

1029
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,720
All right.

1030
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,280
Are you really trying
to find Florence's killer?

1031
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,920
I'm sorry I got so heated.

1032
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,880
It was a great shock
seeing...

1033
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,560
material.

1034
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,640
I was never shown
the pictures of

1035
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,280
what was done to her.

1036
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,280
How well do you know Mabel?

1037
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,120
I'll bet she told you
how awful I was.

1038
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,560
How the family hated her
relationship with Florence.

1039
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,040
Truth is I couldn't care less
that my cousin preferred women.

1040
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,920
I just didn't like the fact
that the woman she preferred

1041
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,000
was such a controlling,
malign influence.

1042
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,440
You have strong feelings
for a woman you never met.

1043
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,240
Because Mabel always refused.

1044
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,440
It was easier
to keep her distance

1045
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,040
and pour poison
into my cousin's ear.

1046
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,600
For all her experience,
Florence was very naive.

1047
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:45,000
She had strong convictions,
but was blind to manipulation.

1048
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,560
You didn't know her.

1049
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,920
Mabel hates me because
she was always jealous

1050
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,840
of anyone Florence cared for.

1051
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,840
Keep up!

1052
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,040
Do you know what always struck
me about Florence's murder?

1053
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,800
The police never questioned

1054
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,840
the last person
to see her alive.

1055
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,280
Mabel Rogers.

1056
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,720
PC Spencer?

1057
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,520
Mr. Pickford is in the garden
talking to Mr. Todd.

1058
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,720
I can see Mr. Todd,
but not Mr. Pickford.

1059
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,280
It was only a minute ago.

1060
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,480
I'm sure Mr. Todd can
tell you where he's gone.

1061
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,160
Or should we wait
for Inspector Dicks?

1062
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,240
You'd better not be lying.

1063
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,280
Why are you out of your room?

1064
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,720
I could ask you
the same thing.

1065
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,880
What are you doing?

1066
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,240
What does it look like?
I'm crying.

1067
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,800
Is there something
I can do to help?

1068
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,720
Find me somewhere to sleep
where my father wasn't killed.

1069
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,760
You lied about
your job, didn't you?

1070
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,800
Leave me alone.

1071
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,000
You almost
killed a young boy,

1072
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,040
then Florence was murdered
and your career was saved.

1073
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,560
What's wrong with you?

1074
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,240
It's a good motive for murder.

1075
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,080
I couldn't murder
anyone. I'm...

1076
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,400
I'm weak, and I'm stupid.

1077
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,440
I'm a pathetic little girl.

1078
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,240
Zaki was right,

1079
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,720
Florence was better
than all of us.

1080
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,760
That maid is responsible
for all of this.

1081
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,760
She deserves
everything she gets,

1082
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,680
and so do you.

1083
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,760
I didn't do it!

1084
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,320
What are you doing in there?

1085
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,960
- Hiding.
- From whom?

1086
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,000
The police.

1087
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,840
Where did you get that?

1088
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,520
Found it under my pillow.

1089
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,040
- Is it loaded?
- Yes.

1090
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,560
Oh, for God's sake, unload it.

1091
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,920
Soldiers used to love
showing me their guns.

1092
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,040
Where have you been?

1093
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,240
I saw Randolph
with our folder.

1094
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,120
I panicked and hid in here,
then someone came into the room,

1095
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,680
and when they'd gone,
I found this.

1096
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,280
I'm being set up.

1097
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,120
It seems so.

1098
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,840
But by whom?

1099
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,680
Daphne.

1100
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,640
She killed her father.

1101
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,000
Uh, why?

1102
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,560
He beat her. She broke.

1103
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,560
The belt.

1104
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,240
Oh, the make-up.

1105
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,720
His work will be under it.

1106
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,440
She was terrified of him.

1107
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,640
So, this is Wade's gun.

1108
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,720
Yes.

1109
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,120
But why blame me?

1110
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,720
The person who benefits most from
your arrest is Florence's killer.

1111
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,440
But surely Daphne
didn't kill Florence.

1112
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,760
It doesn't make sense.

1113
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,400
It does, we're just
missing something.

1114
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,560
I need Florence's diaries.
Did Randolph take them?

1115
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,760
Uh...

1116
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,960
No.

1117
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,000
I've looked through
them a hundred times.

1118
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,280
Keller.

1119
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,320
That's it!

1120
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,000
He killed Florence!

1121
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,080
Oh!

1122
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,960
This isn't what it looks like!

1123
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,880
Well, that's good
because what it looks like

1124
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,439
is a murder suspect pointing
a gun at two police officers.

1125
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,720
It's not loaded.

1126
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:28,640
Don't worry, you haven't
done anything wrong.

1127
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,880
Everything will be all right.

1128
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,800
Get her to the station
and bring some bloody help.

1129
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,359
You can't make it up.

1130
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:36,680
I can explain.

1131
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,640
- No, I mean it.
- So do I.

1132
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,319
No, you couldn't make it up,
could you, Mrs. Christie?

1133
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:45,760
How did you know?

1134
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,399
I spoke to Miss Fisher.

1135
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,720
Oh, she was very convincing,
but the name rang a bell.

1136
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,319
Carlo Fisher,

1137
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:56,640
interviewed in connection with the
disappearance of Mrs. Christie.

1138
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,120
And your disguise, I mean,

1139
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,880
it's good,
but it's not that good.

1140
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,160
You know they've got
aircraft out looking for you.

1141
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,960
Parliament practically
demanded it.

1142
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,200
Parliament!

1143
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,680
You've no idea, have you?

1144
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,200
No.

1145
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,279
If it was up to me,
I'd make you pay for it.

1146
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,720
I'd have you writing till the end
of your days to settle the accounts.

1147
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:23,760
Policemen don't get paid much,
but 5,000 of us soon adds up.

1148
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,319
I don't even know what
to charge you with.

1149
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:30,279
I mean, a ten-pound fine
for wasting police time

1150
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:31,640
hardly seems to cover it.

1151
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,279
Daphne killed her father.

1152
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,319
I'll give you that.

1153
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,680
You knew?

1154
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,200
Of course, she was the only one
in the room when he got shot.

1155
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,680
Doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to
work out she was the most likely.

1156
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,080
Speaking of which, there's another
person you need to make reparations to.

1157
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,800
Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle
held a seance to try

1158
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,680
and track you down, used one
of your gloves apparently.

1159
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,560
Was the cut to her
hand from the recoil?

1160
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,760
Probably.

1161
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,120
Gun this size shouldn't
be shot from the hip.

1162
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,560
She killed him because
of what he did to her.

1163
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,520
That's a defense.

1164
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,640
The jury will understand
if she'll talk,

1165
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,320
but I doubt she will.

1166
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,920
If I was right about Daphne, don't you think
I might be right about the other murder?

1167
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,480
No.

1168
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,360
No more playing detectives.

1169
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,440
Don't you want
to know what's going on?

1170
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,480
That's why
I arrested Miss Rogers.

1171
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,520
Have you ever been obsessed
with something, Inspector?

1172
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,720
Just the law, Mrs. Christie.

1173
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:41,240
A while ago, I realized that's
what I write about, obsession.

1174
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,200
The inability to clear
something from one's mind.

1175
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,480
I'm not in the mood
for philosophizing.

1176
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,080
There's no philosophy
in obsession,

1177
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,000
just feeling, usually pain.

1178
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,600
I mean it, let's go.

1179
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,280
Mabel is obsessed with finding the
killer of the person she loved.

1180
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,000
I dare say she's been obsessed with
Florence since the day they met.

1181
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,080
That's what it's like in my experience.

1182
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,920
My husband is leaving me.

1183
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,680
He's been having an
affair with a 24-year-old.

1184
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,280
They consummated their
relationship on a golf course.

1185
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,760
But I didn't come
here to escape him.

1186
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,240
If I could, I'd spend
every minute by his side.

1187
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,080
I recognized that
obsession in Mabel.

1188
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,080
I came here to help
the both of us.

1189
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,760
When I came back
from the war,

1190
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,200
my wife gave me the clap.

1191
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,080
In my experience,

1192
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,600
obsession's like getting
caught in no-man's land.

1193
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,880
You'd get out if you could,
but you don't know where

1194
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,200
the bullets are
coming from,

1195
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:21,080
so you're better off sitting in the
shell hole and covering your ears.

1196
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,800
You never know,
you might get lucky.

1197
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,320
Do you really know
who killed Florence?

1198
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,640
I have a plan,
but I need your help.

1199
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,080
Well,

1200
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,920
it's the first time
I've eaten with a pig.

1201
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,440
No offense.

1202
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,960
This is a first
time I've eaten

1203
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,680
with a group of
people gotten together

1204
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,240
under false pretenses with
the promise of an inheritance.

1205
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,760
When can we leave?

1206
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,200
When PC Spencer gets back,

1207
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,280
he'll start ferrying
you to the station.

1208
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,040
Short statement, then
you're none of my concern.

1209
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,560
Unless, of course,
your impatience

1210
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,360
is the sign
of a guilty conscience.

1211
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,440
Don't worry, I have my killer.

1212
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:23,040
I still do not understand why Miss
Rogers tried to murder Daphne.

1213
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,880
I wouldn't normally discuss a
case, but under the circumstances,

1214
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,880
Miss Rogers thought
that Miss Miller

1215
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,120
had killed her friend Florence.

1216
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,360
This whole debacle was
an elaborate act of revenge.

1217
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,040
Unbelievable!

1218
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,600
What is it they
say about revenge?

1219
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,720
Dig two graves.

1220
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,960
She'll hang for sure.

1221
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,640
I want to apologize,

1222
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,200
when I take jobs, I tend not to
think about the consequences.

1223
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,560
In my experience, the greatest
harm is done by people

1224
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,360
who pursue a course of action,

1225
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,560
despite being told of
the damage it will do.

1226
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,360
When I was in Verdun--

1227
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,120
Oh, not the bloody war again.

1228
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,600
Here's to the
family that never was.

1229
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,960
Where's Daphne?

1230
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,240
She's not feeling very well,

1231
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,960
said she was going
to stay in her room.

1232
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,280
I'll check on her,

1233
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,560
given what I've put
that poor girl through.

1234
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,720
For the record...

1235
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,120
I think you should look again
at the murder of my cousin.

1236
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,800
It's quite possible
this Rogers woman

1237
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,960
is some sort of
homicidal maniac.

1238
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,400
Yes, it's true.

1239
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,680
Some people do get
a taste for murder.

1240
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,040
Inspector Dicks said
you'd be coming to see me.

1241
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,280
What's going on?

1242
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,840
Pamela said Miss Rogers
has been arrested.

1243
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,000
Yes.

1244
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,520
She was found with the gun
you used to kill your father.

1245
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,400
I can't imagine what
you've been through.

1246
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,360
I should have used
that gun on myself.

1247
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,720
All that matters now is
that we find the people

1248
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,800
who blackmailed
you to frame Mabel.

1249
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,240
None of this is your fault.

1250
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,120
Did your father leave England
to escape conscription?

1251
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,760
He beat my mother
and I our whole life,

1252
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,600
and then he ran
away from the fight.

1253
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,760
If you tell the truth,
they'll understand.

1254
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,960
The truth is,

1255
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,920
I wish I'd shot
that bastard years ago.

1256
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,040
I killed him.

1257
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,280
I know.

1258
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,080
But you didn't plan it.

1259
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,640
You're not a murderer.

1260
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,080
We'll help you.

1261
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,520
Someone else knew it was me.

1262
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,400
Yes.

1263
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,840
Why did you say "people"?

1264
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,120
How is Daphne?

1265
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,960
As good
as can be expected.

1266
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,960
Perhaps you might take
her something to eat.

1267
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,320
Not very subtle, is he?

1268
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,920
I still have some of
Miss Rogers' material.

1269
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,760
Given that most of it
relates to your cousin

1270
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,760
perhaps you would
like to take it,

1271
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,760
assuming the inspector
doesn't mind.

1272
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,080
That would be kind.

1273
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:06,640
That awful women kept so much
that was personal to the family.

1274
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,280
It would be very
gratifying to get it back.

1275
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,560
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about the inspector.

1276
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,320
He has other things
on his mind.

1277
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,360
He's with Travis

1278
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,320
who seems to have forgotten
his cousin's golden rule.

1279
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,040
Daphne asked if you would
check in on her after dinner.

1280
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,760
Where's Daphne?
We're starting to worry.

1281
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,200
When you beat Florence to
death, what did you think about?

1282
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,800
I've always wondered.

1283
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,400
During the act of murder, is
there anything but the act itself?

1284
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,320
Does the brain reject
what the body is doing,

1285
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,000
or is there gratification?

1286
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,840
Did you enjoy it?

1287
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,960
Did Florence even understand
why you were doing it?

1288
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,240
That she was being killed
for saving a man's life.

1289
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,560
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1290
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,960
Your son James would be
alive were it not for Florence.

1291
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,920
She saved the man who murdered
him, Captain Dieter Keller.

1292
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,800
A man everyone told her should
be left to die, a monster.

1293
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,120
But, as Mr. Hanachi said,
Florence helped everyone

1294
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,440
regardless of who they
were or what they'd done.

1295
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,240
- We're leaving. -Was it you in
the compartment next to Florence

1296
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,200
making sure she was
alone with your son?

1297
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,800
This is as insulting
as it is stupid.

1298
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,760
Not as stupid as leaving a bloody
footprint at the scene of the crime.

1299
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,360
If you'd had the stomach
to kill her yourself,

1300
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,640
I doubt such a mistake
would have been made.

1301
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,120
You planned everything
so carefully.

1302
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,080
Florence told you which
train she was traveling on,

1303
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,440
which carriage she'd be in.

1304
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,680
You hid a coat and cap
underneath the bench seat

1305
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,480
for Franklin to wear
when he escaped.

1306
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,920
If I were you, I'd stop.

1307
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,120
You left evidence
in the compartment.

1308
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,960
Evidence the police still have.

1309
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,120
Evidence that will send you
and your mother to the gallows.

1310
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,360
The footprint?

1311
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,720
There's a million servicemen
it could have come from.

1312
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,920
And a million crimes
left unpunished.

1313
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,360
How did you feel when you found
out that Florence wasn't dead?

1314
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,760
That despite all your
mother's plans, you'd failed.

1315
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,200
I didn't want to kill her.

1316
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,280
Franklin!

1317
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,960
I bashed her skull just
enough to get her attention.

1318
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,640
I wanted her to understand
why it was happening.

1319
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,200
I explained that her death was the
result of her sanctimonious morality.

1320
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,840
And I bashed her
skull a bit more.

1321
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,360
As an ex-priest, I'm
compelled to offer confession

1322
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,480
and absolution to someone
approaching death.

1323
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,120
But as I told Florence before
I beat her into a coma...

1324
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,680
not everyone can be saved.

1325
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,080
Something else I didn't
learn in the army.

1326
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,200
We were in the next room.
We heard every word.

1327
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,800
Who'd have thought that the walls
in this place would be so thin?

1328
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,600
But you knew that,
didn't ya?

1329
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,480
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1330
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:22,400
You and your son listened to
what happened to Mr. Miller.

1331
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,000
And then you blackmailed Daphne
into framing Miss Rogers.

1332
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,720
- Really?
- Yes!

1333
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,240
And you've implicated yourself
in a premeditated murder.

1334
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,040
The only thing that's happened here
is a vicious assault on my son.

1335
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,040
Whatever you
think you've heard,

1336
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,280
I'd like to know what
evidence you have

1337
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,480
to back up these
scandalous accusations.

1338
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,720
A murder weapon perhaps?

1339
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,200
Maybe an item of clothing?

1340
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:50,080
I heard something about
a pair of bloody boots.

1341
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,560
That sounds incriminating.

1342
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,320
You have them, I assume.

1343
01:21:58,600 --> 01:21:59,760
I didn't think so.

1344
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,520
Nothing that was said
here can be used in court.

1345
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,440
This pathetic attempt
at entrapment is over.

1346
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,560
You failed.

1347
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,400
Pamela Rose,
you are under arrest

1348
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,440
for the murder of Wade Miller.

1349
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,320
You do not have to say anything,
but if you do say anything,

1350
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,800
it will be taken down and
may be used in evidence.

1351
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,080
You wouldn't?

1352
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,760
Zaki?

1353
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,400
I saw Mrs. Rose take the
gun from Wade's luggage.

1354
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,160
That's a lie.

1355
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,000
It was Mabel, she deserves it.

1356
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,280
You know that.

1357
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,720
Mrs. Rose left this note
in Daphne's room.

1358
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,760
There's been a horrible
misunderstanding.

1359
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,120
Whatever they've told you,
it isn't true.

1360
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,320
I caught a glimpse of the
killer through the door.

1361
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,400
It was him.

1362
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,520
You can't do this.

1363
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:28,240
Let me know if his
balls don't recover.

1364
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,160
I'll say a prayer, or two.

1365
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:34,960
No.

1366
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,520
No!

1367
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,720
All right?

1368
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,920
Will you be all right?

1369
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,240
I hope so.

1370
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:15,960
I'm sorry.

1371
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,440
About Mabel?

1372
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,720
I was wrong about her.

1373
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,320
She surprised you.

1374
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,560
Yes.

1375
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,360
People don't often
surprise in a good way.

1376
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,120
No, no, I suppose not.

1377
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,640
Would you do me a favor?

1378
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,200
I'd like to ask Mabel to tea.

1379
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,560
Tea?

1380
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,040
That's what he said.

1381
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,600
Her family have spent 20 years
pretending I didn't exist.

1382
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,520
Inspector Dicks says
if I'm not found

1383
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,840
in the next 24 hours,
they'll call out the army.

1384
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,040
Will you go home?

1385
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,760
What will you say?

1386
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:24,920
Can't remember.

1387
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,200
One minute I was driving
my car, the next...

1388
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,720
Amnesia!

1389
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,800
Really!

1390
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,760
It's like something
from a bad novel.

1391
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,880
Dicks told me
to keep it simple.

1392
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,040
He's going to help.

1393
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,200
What will you do?

1394
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,560
Finding Florence's killer is all
I've thought about for six years.

1395
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,240
How do I stop?

1396
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,760
I have no idea.

1397
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,560
You have your family.

1398
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,160
The police questioned
Archie about my disappearance.

1399
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,640
They probably think he knocked
me off in order to marry Nancy.

1400
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,720
And get an inheritance.

1401
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,520
I better change my will.

1402
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,720
I'll agree to a divorce.

1403
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,840
And I'll stop living my
life through Florence's death.

1404
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,200
I don't want to.

1405
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,160
Me neither.

1406
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,120
Now then.

1407
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,400
Bloody hell, should I put
you two on suicide watch?

1408
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,120
We're discussing the future.

1409
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:57,560
Bad, is it?

1410
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,280
Worse than being hung for
a crime you didn't commit?

1411
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,560
Or being caught up in
a scandal so spectacular,

1412
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,120
you'd want to settle down
with a nice big nightcap?

1413
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,560
Knowing that
things could be worse

1414
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,280
is not much comfort,
in my experience.

1415
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,160
Well, that's true.

1416
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,320
Still, be good
for your writing.

1417
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:25,320
The novel I'm working on is terrible.
It won't help that.

1418
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,240
With the sensation you've
caused, you could publish

1419
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,600
a book on concrete ratios and
it'd still be a bestseller.

1420
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,480
Just have to have
the right title.

1421
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,720
Make it simple.

1422
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,680
Murder on the Building Site.

1423
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,320
I don't think my
publishers would agree.

1424
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,960
Well, as we sat here talking, they're busy
getting everything together they've got

1425
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,480
just in case you turn up dead.

1426
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,880
Oh, thanks, I feel much better.

1427
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,680
Did we do the right thing?

1428
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,840
Well, I am glad
I'll join this conversation.

1429
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,520
They'll hang.

1430
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,200
They murdered in cold
blood, that's what it's for.

1431
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,800
Does it feel like justice?

1432
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,240
Yes, but...

1433
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,800
It's a funny
kind of justice

1434
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,240
that's carried out by
a group of strangers.

1435
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,120
If she were alive, Florence
would be helping strangers.

1436
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,640
You never told me
why you suspected

1437
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,640
Franklin and Pamela
in the first place.

1438
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,440
Apart from you,
they were the only people

1439
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,920
who knew which train and
carriage Florence was in.

1440
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,840
Once I stopped
indulging fantasies,

1441
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,640
they were the most
likely suspects.

1442
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,240
Hmm.

1443
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,320
It's a shame
the truth of murder

1444
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,480
doesn't lend itself
to detective stories.

1445
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:58,440
Well, it won't be much good
if the person most likely

1446
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,280
to have done it,
actually did it.

1447
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,280
No,

1448
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,840
that would never work.

1449
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,800
Time to go.

1450
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,400
I just got comfy.
Was it something I said?

1451
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,800
No, Inspector.

1452
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,960
Something I thought.
