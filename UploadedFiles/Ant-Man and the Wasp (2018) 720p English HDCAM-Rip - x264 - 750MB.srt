1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,687
Gone forever.

2
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:21,137
Telling you that she
wasn't coming home,

3
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:24,209
was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.

4
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,935
But then, Scott showed up...

5
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:33,343
Or should I say, broke
into our house.

6
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:37,241
And when he went to
the Quantum Realm....

7
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:43,466
And came back,
everything changed.

8
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:47,458
I started to wonder...

9
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:50,263
Could your Mother
still be alive?

10
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:54,992
So I dusted off some old plans.

11
00:01:04,082 --> 00:01:06,590
Dad, what are you saying?

12
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:10,691
I think it's possible,
to bring her back.

13
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:52,220
Okay. We're in.

14
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:58,955
Aw, this place is a maze.
Where's that map?

15
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:04,127
We're definitely close.

16
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:05,804
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.

17
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:09,218
Are you sure? Once we're inside,
you show any hesitation or fear,

18
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:11,999
- we're done.
- I eat fear for breakfast.

19
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,999
Wow. That is super cool.
Come on.

20
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:23,432
Look! It's Anton. He'll
show us the way.

21
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:25,870
Anton, which way do we go?

22
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:30,476
Anton, which way do we go?

23
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:39,628
Thanks, Anton.

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,698
Look! The ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

25
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,940
Oh, no! Lasers!

26
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:50,206
Oh! I got lased!

27
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,783
The secret vault.

28
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:58,338
- Tell me you brought the contact lens.
- Yup!

29
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,010
Perfect! Right there.

30
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:09,627
There! It's the microtreasure.

31
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:11,768
My trophy?

32
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:14,518
- It looks like treasure.
- Oh, it is to me.

33
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,002
- I wanna take it to show and tell.
- Oh, you can't do that. Can't.

34
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,385
It never leaves the house.
It's too important.

35
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:23,049
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

36
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:25,845
I'm so touched you think I'm
the World's Greatest Grandma.

37
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:29,720
- It was the only one they have.
- It makes me wanna get you a sweater.

38
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,533
- Oh, no, the fuzz!
- Hey, Scotty.

39
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:36,150
I was looking at the schematics
for the Karapetyan buildings,

40
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,986
and I think we have way too
many security cams, don't we?

41
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,783
- No, not at all.
- 'Cause, it's a lot of security cameras.

42
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:44,541
I know what he needs. Who's the
security expert in our business?

43
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:46,299
You are. But I'm running
the company, right?

44
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:49,104
And if we overcoat him, he's gonna go
somewhere else, so we got to land this bird.

45
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,627
He can go on anywhere. And the
expression is "landing the fish."

46
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,400
No, it's "land the bird."

47
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,729
Just like landing a plane. You gotta
land the plane to be in business.

48
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:58,259
I know it's silly to get hung up on
these kinds of things. But I do...

49
00:03:58,283 --> 00:04:00,673
How am I gonna land a fish?
It can't walk.

50
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:04,290
And if it swam up on shore, and it
battled a hawk, who's gonna win?

51
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:07,189
You've really turned me
around on this thing.

52
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:09,774
It's okay. We're gonna
land Karapetyan.

53
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,884
Now if you'd just excuse me, I'm in the middle
of trying to steal something with my daughter.

54
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:14,283
I'm gonna go recheck it.

55
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:16,790
Don't just stand there!

56
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:20,407
Let's bounce before
the po-po come back!

57
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:23,399
Po-po? How do you
even know that?

58
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:26,579
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

59
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,476
Crash landing!

60
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:45,093
- I wish we could shrink for real.
- It is pretty cool.

61
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,201
Hey, I'm headed to
the office, Scotty.

62
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:48,866
Hey, sorry about freaking
out earlier, you know?

63
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,866
But I feel like... I'm way better. Like, my heart
is definitely like, beating way too hard and stuff?

64
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:54,616
And, like, my hands are shaking. But
I think it's unrelated, you know?

65
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,085
It's gonna be great, Luis. You
got nothing to worry about.

66
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:59,678
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

67
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:01,569
I'm the boss. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:02,772
Daddy!

69
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,022
Come on, Woo. I've
got three days left.

70
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,898
- Why would I try to escape?
- Sorry, Scott. Rules are rules.

71
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:15,859
You trip a perimeter alarm
and we search the place.

72
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,351
Keel, stern, suits and nuts.

73
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:21,429
Thank you. It was an accident.
My foot went through the fence.

74
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:23,015
Our flying ant crashed.

75
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:26,695
Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year
old when you can't leave the house.

76
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:28,838
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

77
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:31,827
Close-up magic.

78
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:36,007
I learned that.

79
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:38,897
Why can't you just
leave my Daddy alone?

80
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:40,874
Oh, Cassie.

81
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:45,429
This must all seem like a bunch of
confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh?

82
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:47,124
Well, think of it this way:

83
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:49,483
Your school has rules, right?
Like...

84
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:51,429
You can't draw on the walls.

85
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:55,257
Well, your Daddy went to Germany and
drew on the walls with Captain America.

86
00:05:55,273 --> 00:06:00,051
And that was a violation of Article 16,
Paragraph 3 of the Sokovia Accords.

87
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:04,263
Now as a part of his joint plea deal with
Homeland Security and the German government,

88
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:08,545
he's allowed to return to the U.S., provided
he serve two years under house arrest,

89
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:10,655
followed by three
years of probation.

90
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:13,592
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology,

91
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:17,483
or contact with any former associates,
who were or currently are,

92
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:21,029
in violation of said Accords.
Or any related statutes.

93
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,537
Okay, sweetie?

94
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:25,702
Wow. You're really
great with kids!

95
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,889
Thanks. I'm also a youth pastor.

96
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:30,514
Anyway, not to be a
Johnny Ass-calade,

97
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,624
but you haven't had any contact with
Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

98
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:35,280
- No.
- You sure?

99
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:37,476
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get them.

100
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,156
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

101
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:43,172
Associating with them breaks your deal.
And, uhh...

102
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:45,196
I don't need to
remind you, that...

103
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:49,175
Any violation of your agreement
means 20 years in prison. Minimum.

104
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,495
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

105
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:53,979
- They hate his guts.
- Thanks, Peanut.

106
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:58,464
- How'd you do it, Scott?
- Do what?

107
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:01,487
The card trick?

108
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:03,448
Seriously?

109
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:05,675
Oh, my God!

110
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:09,589
You people can't just show up here,
whenever you want and search the place.

111
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:10,836
Actually, they can.

112
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,000
- You need a warrant.
- Actually, they don't.

113
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,000
Really? Wow.

114
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:18,695
- Did you pack your soccer shoes?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:22,992
Next time I see you,
will be on the outside!

116
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:27,091
I'll get on the inside of this.

117
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:28,817
- Three days!
- Seriously?

118
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:30,028
- I'm proud of you, buddy.
- Thank you.

119
00:07:30,045 --> 00:07:32,443
- You know what? Give me another one.
- Me, too!

120
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:36,459
Freedom, business, I'm
sensing greatness.

121
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:39,153
- I had a fun weekend, Daddy.
- Me too, Peanut.

122
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:42,701
Just wait till next weekend. Once I'm outta
here, we're gonna go paint this town red.

123
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:45,726
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

124
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,887
- You're getting good at that.
- How'd you do that?

125
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:57,935
- Bye, Daddy!
- Bye!

126
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:01,412
- Bye!
- Bye!

127
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,068
Three days...

128
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:08,013
Easy-peasy.

129
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:34,266
Snap your fingers. That
gets them to look over there.

130
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:36,524
Now that is misdirection.

131
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:18,360
Easy-peasy.

132
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:43,755
Lost... in the
Quantum Realm.

133
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,839
What?

134
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:56,690
I'm gonna find
you, Jellybean.

135
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:03,650
I found you!

136
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,017
You always find
me, Mommy.

137
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,126
What the hell?

138
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:23,913
Hey, Hank.

139
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:25,508
It's been a while.

140
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,969
Umm... I don't even know
if this is your number...

141
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,016
Anymore... and,

142
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:32,843
I'm probably the last person
you wanna hear from. But...

143
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:36,323
I just had a really
weird dream.

144
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:40,417
And I know that doesn't sound like an
emergency or anything, but it just felt...

145
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,831
Very real.

146
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:46,309
I was back in the
Quantum Realm, and...

147
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:49,480
I think I saw your wife.

148
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,191
And then I
was your wife.

149
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,463
I mean, not in
a weird way, or...

150
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:58,221
You know...

151
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:02,094
Hearing this out loud, I'm
thinking, it's not an emergency.

152
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,437
I'm sorry I
bothered you.

153
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,648
I'm sorry for
a lot of things.

154
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:00,604
Hope?

155
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,039
Is this another dream?

156
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:07,921
Do you think it's a dream? Or is it possible
that you really saw my Mom down there?

157
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,538
I'm not sure.

158
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:16,636
I can't be here! I can't be,
I'm under house arrest.

159
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:19,838
They won't open while the
system's engaged, Scott.

160
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:40,628
You have to
take me home.

161
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,378
- They can show up any second.
- Relax...

162
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:44,995
As far as your nanny cops
know, you're still at home.

163
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:52,603
Woah!

164
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,703
Scotty?

165
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:02,172
He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.

166
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:04,656
Nine hours in bed, five
hours in front of the TV,

167
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:07,071
two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

168
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:08,767
That's totally inaccurate.

169
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,128
How do you know about my daily
routine? Are you spying on me?

170
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,290
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

171
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:15,855
And so far, the biggest
one we've had is you.

172
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,026
I'm sorry about Germany.

173
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,205
They just showed up. They said it
was a matter of national security,

174
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,736
- That Cap needed help.
- Who's Cap?

175
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:29,462
...tain America.
Captain... Cap.

176
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:31,893
It's what we call him.

177
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,021
If you're a friend. I think I'm a friend,
a little. I know him. He's not, we're not...

178
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:38,749
I'm sorry! All right? I didn't
think I'd get caught.

179
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,102
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

180
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:43,086
How's Hank?

181
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:46,618
We're still running, the house is gone. So
is our freedom. How do you think he is?

182
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,796
I'm sorry. I know
you're mad.

183
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,227
I'm not looking
for apologies, Scott.

184
00:13:50,252 --> 00:13:54,212
The only reason why we're even talking
is because we need what's in your head.

185
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,392
Is this where
you're living?

186
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:38,876
If you need help, money
or something, maybe I can...

187
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,267
We're fine.

188
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,482
Hey, Hank. Look...

189
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:41,677
- I just want to...
- Save it.

190
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:46,822
- Can we start?
- Yeah.

191
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:51,705
So, while you were relaxing
at home, we were building this.

192
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,096
It's a tunnel. To
the Quantum Realm.

193
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,526
To my Mom.

194
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,143
We think she might still be down
there, we just don't know where.

195
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,167
What?

196
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:05,339
If we can pinpoint my Mom's location,
then the pod can take me down to get her.

197
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,190
You built all this and you
don't even know if she's alive?

198
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:10,235
It's called a hypothesis.

199
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,088
Last night we powered up the tunnel for the
first time. It overloaded, and it shut down.

200
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:17,033
But for a split second,

201
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,017
the doorway to the
Quantum Realm was opened.

202
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,065
And?

203
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,682
And five minutes later, you
called. Talking about Mom.

204
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:28,690
We think when you went down there,
you may have entangled with her.

205
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,275
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

206
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,377
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

207
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:38,165
We think she might have put some kind of
message in your head. Hopefully, a location.

208
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:39,782
And opening the
tunnel triggered it.

209
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:43,384
Your Mom put a message in my
head? Come on. That's insane.

210
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:45,883
No, Scott. Insane...

211
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:49,541
is going to Germany without
telling us and fighting the Avengers.

212
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:52,713
Just tell me you weren't
lying about the suit you took.

213
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:55,939
Tell me you
really destroyed it.

214
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:58,158
I did. I destroyed it. I swear.

215
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:00,720
I can't believe you
destroyed my suit.

216
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,645
That was my life's work.

217
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:06,858
- What was I supposed to do?
- You were supposed to not take my suit!

218
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:09,432
I'm sorry, Hank. I'm
sorry I took the suit.

219
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:11,714
I'm sorry that
I called last night.

220
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,292
I don't remember seeing Janet
down there. I wish that I did.

221
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:19,026
I just had a dream about her playing
hide and seek with a little girl.

222
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:22,579
What?

223
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,044
I had a dream. She was playing
hide and seek with a little...

224
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:32,591
girl. Cassie and I do it all the
time. It doesn't mean anything.

225
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,161
But, was it Cassie
in the dream?

226
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:36,242
No.

227
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:38,234
- Where was she hiding?
- What?

228
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:41,515
The little girl, where was she
hiding. Was it in a wardrobe?

229
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:44,289
No, it's in a tall dresser.

230
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:47,047
- You mean a wardrobe.
- Is that what that's called?

231
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:51,086
- What color was it?
- Red.

232
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,086
- Were there horses on it?
- Oh, boy.

233
00:17:56,961 --> 00:18:00,172
It's where I hid every
time we played.

234
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,781
Doesn't sound like you really
got the gist of the game.

235
00:18:05,312 --> 00:18:07,077
She's alive!

236
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:10,296
I knew it.

237
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:12,788
I knew it!

238
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:16,859
- We need to get that part.
- Okay.

239
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:21,640
The sooner we get the tunnel working, the
sooner we can get this message out his head.

240
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:23,477
- Does Burch have it?
- Yeah. Let's go.

241
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,353
What part? Who's Burch?
Wait, what's happening?

242
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,279
We need a component to stop
the tunnel from overloading again.

243
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:34,872
I brought your clothes.
You might wanna change.

244
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,997
Look. I'd really like
to help you out.

245
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:50,130
But if I'm not home when they come to take off
my ankle monitor then I'm going away forever.

246
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:54,404
Once we get the component and power up the tunnel,
we'll get the message and have you home by lunch.

247
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:56,702
We have to hurry. The
entanglement won't last.

248
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:58,234
You owe us.

249
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:02,264
All right, fine. But can I just wait inside?
Because I'm not supposed to be out here.

250
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:13,837
Let's go.

251
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:32,510
- We good?
- Yeah.

252
00:19:32,526 --> 00:19:34,354
I'll be right back.

253
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,432
- Can I have one of those?
- No.

254
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:00,316
Susan!

255
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:02,644
- Welcome to Oui!
- Sonny.

256
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:06,012
Oui is French for yes. As
in, yes, we found a table,

257
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:08,304
yes, you saw
us, and yes,

258
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:10,836
to planning before property.

259
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:12,929
Well, let's hope it
also means yes to

260
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:15,359
do you have the
component I ordered?

261
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:19,530
You know, I've always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

262
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:21,569
- Have a seat.
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

263
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,874
- Who is this guy?
- Sonny Burch.

264
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:26,609
He traffics in black
market technology.

265
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:29,775
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

266
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:33,765
- Can I just have one?
- No.

267
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:39,891
You know, I have a special friend, down
at the FBI. And I say special, because...

268
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:43,797
Well, he tells me things that
I didn't previously know.

269
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:45,766
For example...

270
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,133
Your name isn't Susan.

271
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,735
It's Hope Van Dyne.

272
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:53,673
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

273
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:56,274
- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.

274
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,687
What do you want?

275
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:08,218
Relationships are
built on trust, Hope.

276
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:10,546
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

277
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,139
- Our relationship?
- Well, business landscape's been shifting, Hope.

278
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:18,328
Hell, screw it. I don't even exist
anymore. But now, Hank Pym?

279
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:22,281
- Hank Pym, is a real opportunity.
- Do you have a point?

280
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,430
You think that I don't know what
you've been building? With all of this?

281
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:28,633
Quantum technology.

282
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:32,782
And you can forget nano-tech.
Forget AI. Forget cryptocurrency.

283
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:36,181
Quantum energy is the future.
It's the next gold rush.

284
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,992
I want in, Hope.

285
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:41,723
So, as a gesture of goodwill,
I've taken the liberty

286
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:44,442
of arranging some
buyers for your lab.

287
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:49,363
Starting bid?
One billion dollars.

288
00:21:49,457 --> 00:21:51,113
Thank you,
Sonny. Really.

289
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:55,172
But my father and I have something slightly
more pressing than starting a business.

290
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:58,335
So, I'll just take the component.
As arranged.

291
00:21:58,492 --> 00:22:01,538
My buyers don't take
no for an answer.

292
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:06,677
So, we're either in business together,
or we aren't in business together.

293
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:13,329
- Then, I guess we aren't.
- You can go.

294
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:16,636
But, I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

295
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:19,807
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

296
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,584
Listen, Sonny.

297
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:25,966
This is gonna be so much easier on
everybody if you just give me that component.

298
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:29,708
No, the only thing you're
taking from here, is my heart.

299
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:32,466
But it will mend in time.

300
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:34,825
Okay.

301
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:45,687
- So now, what?
- You'll see.

302
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:48,773
She said her and daddy
had something pressing.

303
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,515
I wanna know what it is, 'cause if they're not
working with us, they're working with somebody.

304
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:54,334
So find out. Name...

305
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,700
Hold on. You
gave her wings?

306
00:23:23,322 --> 00:23:26,220
Not my 36-feet chandelier!

307
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:31,946
Stop firing! Stop!

308
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,074
Alright, take this. Go.
Go, go, go, go!

309
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:43,473
Wings and blasters.

310
00:24:43,598 --> 00:24:45,489
I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me?

311
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:46,793
No, I did.

312
00:24:48,536 --> 00:24:50,739
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

313
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:53,670
Oh, our business isn't
finished yet, Hope.

314
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,857
I can assure
you of that.

315
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,727
What the hell is that?

316
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:19,595
Dad, are you
seeing this?

317
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,884
Hope, get out of there!

318
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:31,656
- I gotta do something.
- Wait!

319
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:39,149
It's still a work in progress.

320
00:25:58,238 --> 00:25:59,816
You taught me that
kick. Remember?

321
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:02,105
- Yeah, great form.
- Those were the days.

322
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:04,792
- Whatever happened to us?
- Not the time, Scott.

323
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:06,996
Dammit, where did he go?

324
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,834
I lost it.

325
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:12,531
I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.

326
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:15,225
Dad?

327
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:26,013
Give me that. Now.

328
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:33,191
- Are you okay?
- No. He got the lab.

329
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:34,811
- No.
- Come on.

330
00:26:37,488 --> 00:26:40,081
- What was that?
- I don't know.

331
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,628
But we need to find somewhere to
regroup and figure out where the lab is.

332
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:46,370
So where to now?

333
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,213
How about my house? Mmm?
I'm supposed to be there anyway.

334
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:52,986
- Woo could walk in any second.
- Exactly why we're not going to your house.

335
00:26:53,018 --> 00:26:54,814
What about your house?

336
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:56,439
Sorry.

337
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:00,306
There is one place
I can think of.

338
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:01,994
No.

339
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:05,127
No, no! No! No!

340
00:27:06,564 --> 00:27:08,024
No!

341
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,173
Wow, Dr. Pym.

342
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,188
Like, who would've thought
that, once again,

343
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,055
in your hour of need, that you
would turn to us? You know?

344
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:19,103
Not me.

345
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,462
Help yourself.

346
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,290
That was overexpensive pastry.
We gotta keep the food budget down.

347
00:27:23,306 --> 00:27:25,305
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

348
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:28,040
- The oatmeal packets.
- Oatmeal packets.

349
00:27:28,073 --> 00:27:29,746
- It's insult.
- Why's it insult?

350
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:32,496
- Because it takes like sand.
- You know why? Cause it's organic.

351
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:35,019
- That is not organic. It's sand.
- The most important meal of the day.

352
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:38,253
You know what, you can get creative
with it. Put a little brown sugar on it.

353
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:39,988
 Sprinkle some cinnamon...

354
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,831
Guys, guys, guys, guys!
Come on, man!

355
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:44,784
We got bigger fish to fry.

356
00:27:44,842 --> 00:27:47,365
- Is that my desk?
- Yeah.

357
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:49,760
What? Why do I have
such a small desk?

358
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:52,503
- Cause you weren't there when we're choosing desks.
- You snooze, you lose.

359
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,066
- I was under house arrest.
- Yeah!

360
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,581
You know what, this isn't
even a desk. This is garbage.

361
00:27:56,613 --> 00:27:59,227
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

362
00:27:59,252 --> 00:28:00,626
I got it out of
rummage sale.

363
00:28:00,651 --> 00:28:02,986
- So, you saved money on my desk?
- Guys.

364
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,588
Hope, please! We need
to focus. All right?

365
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,100
We gotta find that
lab already. Geez.

366
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:11,332
Oh, you know what? I heard stories,
like what happened to you.

367
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,957
Like this crazy, creepy cat who like,
walks through walls and stuff.

368
00:28:13,982 --> 00:28:15,630
Like a... Like a Ghost!

369
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:17,864
Like Baba Yaga.

370
00:28:20,247 --> 00:28:22,684
Baba Yaga. A witch.

371
00:28:22,763 --> 00:28:25,489
They tell stories to
children to frighten them.

372
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,208
You know Baba Yaga?

373
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:31,052
Whoever stole it...

374
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:32,411
We need to find it.

375
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,715
Well, you don't find
someone like that.

376
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:37,574
- They find you.
- Like Baba Yaga.

377
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:40,692
Dr. Pym, you're like the
smartest genius I know.

378
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:43,221
Did you put some kind
of lojack on your lab?

379
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:46,353
Because if you didn't, we have a
variety of affordable options.

380
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:48,540
Of course, I did, Luis.

381
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:50,072
It was disabled.

382
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,814
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

383
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:55,884
- They also looked like they were phasing.
- Phasing?

384
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:59,173
Quantum phasing. When an object
moves through different states of matter.

385
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,111
Oh, yeah. That's what
I was thinking.

386
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:04,986
The lab emits radiation. Could we modify
a quantum spectrometer and track it?

387
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:07,923
That could work, yes. But all
of my equipment is in the lab.

388
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:10,321
Well, where else can
we find that equipment?

389
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:14,126
Well, there is one person.

390
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,025
- Bill Foster.
- Great!

391
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:18,306
Who's Bill Foster?

392
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:21,212
He's an old colleague
of my Dad's. From SHIELD.

393
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:25,025
- They had a falling out years ago.
- You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.

394
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,126
It's probably just
a waste of time.

395
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:30,445
Hey, I'm risking everything by being
here. Don't you think we should check?

396
00:29:30,493 --> 00:29:33,117
We need to find out
who took the lab.

397
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:28,278
Guys, it's not a good idea
to be out in the open like this.

398
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:31,371
Relax. No one's gonna
recognize us.

399
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,871
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

400
00:30:33,896 --> 00:30:35,465
It's not a disguise, Hank.

401
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:37,895
We look like ourselves
in a baseball game.

402
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:39,934
In an isolated system...

403
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,114
Particles co-exist in a

404
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:46,684
stable phase relationship. If
the system is interfered with,

405
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:49,999
that stability becomes chaos.

406
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:52,085
Unpredictable.

407
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:53,499
Dangerous.

408
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:54,999
Beautiful.

409
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:59,671
Isolated completely, a quantum system would
revert back to separate states of matter.

410
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:03,431
Each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

411
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:04,961
In other words...

412
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:08,033
The object in question would
be both in and out of phase

413
00:31:08,057 --> 00:31:10,971
with multiple parallel realities.

414
00:31:16,183 --> 00:31:19,370
Speaking of being out
of phase with reality...

415
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,315
I am noticing an unusally high number
of glazed eyes out there among you.

416
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,223
So, why don't we call
it a few minutes early.

417
00:31:29,248 --> 00:31:33,350
That will be enough for today, thank
you, ladies and gentlemen. You may go.

418
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:37,716
It's incredible.
Your link to Janet.

419
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:38,921
It's Quantum entanglement,

420
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:42,272
between the quantum states composed
of her molecules and your brains.

421
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:44,274
Yeah. It's what I
was thinking.

422
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,046
Do you guys just put the word
'quantum' in front of everything?

423
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:48,711
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

424
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,621
Hope, I'd love to help you but I don't
have the equipment you're describing.

425
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:54,027
I told you this was a waste of time.
Come on. Let's go.

426
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:55,574
Don't condescend, Hank.

427
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,427
You're the one who's on
the run from the FBI.

428
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:59,512
All because you had
to grow to a size

429
00:31:59,537 --> 00:32:01,449
that finally fit your ego.

430
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:04,871
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

431
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:06,485
Really?

432
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,243
Going that big must've
been exhausting.

433
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:12,001
I slept for three days straight.
You have no idea.

434
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:13,134
Actually, I do.

435
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:16,681
Back in the day, I was Hank's partner
in a project called Goliath.

436
00:32:16,712 --> 00:32:18,437
Excuse me, you were my partner?

437
00:32:18,462 --> 00:32:20,899
The only thing more tiring
than going that big,

438
00:32:20,915 --> 00:32:22,907
is putting up with
Hank's bullshit.

439
00:32:27,443 --> 00:32:28,543
How big did you get?

440
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:29,605
My record?

441
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:30,880
Twenty-one feet.

442
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:32,646
- Not bad.
- You?

443
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:35,286
- I don't...
- No, really. I'm curious.

444
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,630
- Sixty-five feet. Yeah.
- Whoa.

445
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,030
- Huge.
- Sixty-five.

446
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:41,748
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

447
00:32:41,935 --> 00:32:44,514
We need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

448
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:48,655
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet? Strange.

449
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:52,538
He had all the answers back in the day.
That's why I left the project.

450
00:32:52,562 --> 00:32:54,889
Left? I fired you.

451
00:32:54,913 --> 00:32:57,427
Best decision I ever made.
Hank was a terrible partner.

452
00:32:57,452 --> 00:33:00,343
Temperamental. Stubborn.
Impatient.

453
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,691
Sooner or later he just
pushed everyone away.

454
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:04,092
Just the mediocrities.

455
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:07,685
Janet was the only one who could
endure him and chose to stick it out.

456
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,600
Watch it, Bill.

457
00:33:08,632 --> 00:33:10,497
She paid the price
though, didn't she?

458
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,313
You son of a...

459
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:13,710
We didn't come here to
listen to you two squabble.

460
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:15,877
I'm trying to save my Mother.

461
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:20,110
It's Woo.

462
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:21,836
Someone must have seen me.

463
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:25,046
Relax. If this is about you
they'd be in your house by now.

464
00:33:27,578 --> 00:33:29,703
- What are you, fifteen?
- Come on. We gotta go, right now.

465
00:33:29,728 --> 00:33:32,907
Wait! You might be able to
improvise that tracker.

466
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:36,399
If you modify the defraction
units on one of your regulators.

467
00:33:36,424 --> 00:33:38,485
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.

468
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:41,006
Thank you.

469
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:55,331
But Doctor, campus police says
they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

470
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:56,628
I don't know what
to tell you, agent.

471
00:33:56,653 --> 00:33:58,855
I haven't talked to
Hank in thirty years.

472
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:01,081
I can assure you I'm the last
person he would wanna visit.

473
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,558
- Oh, come on. You expect us to...
- Hey, hey.

474
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,175
- Why is that?
- Simple.

475
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,168
We hate each other's guts.

476
00:34:09,055 --> 00:34:10,885
So I'm a terrible partner?

477
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,269
Foster, he hasn't had one good
idea in his unremarkable career.

478
00:34:14,294 --> 00:34:16,364
But his idea about the
defractors could work.

479
00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:18,535
Fine, one decent idea.

480
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:22,379
Except I eliminated the defractors
when I upgraded the suits.

481
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:27,039
So if we had an old suit,

482
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:29,351
we might be able to
track down the lab?

483
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:31,554
Yes. But we don't.

484
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:35,338
- What if we did?
- What do you mean?

485
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,809
I mean...

486
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:40,786
- Life's funny...
- Oh, my God.

487
00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:42,895
- You didn't destroy the suit.
- What?!

488
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:46,755
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.
I couldn't destroy that.

489
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:50,806
Before I turned myself in, I shrunk
it down and mailed it to Luis.

490
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:53,064
You sent my suit
through the mail?

491
00:34:53,088 --> 00:34:56,025
Hey, the postal service is
very reliable, you know?

492
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,651
They do tracking numbers now.
Like UPS.

493
00:34:58,667 --> 00:34:59,782
Where is it?

494
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,400
It's in a very safe place, alright?
Don't worry.

495
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:05,220
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

496
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:06,924
What do you mean it's not there?
Where could it be?

497
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:08,541
I've looked everywhere.
It's not here.

498
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:09,917
Hey. Get away from the table.

499
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:12,433
I put it back out
to Cassie, and I...

500
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,370
Show and tell.

501
00:35:14,594 --> 00:35:15,859
Scotty?

502
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,698
Well, the good news is,
I know where it is.

503
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,302
Whenever you go back to school, isn't
everything supposed to look so much smaller?

504
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:33,139
This place seems huge. Ah!

505
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:35,280
- What is it?
- It's the new regulator.

506
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:37,061
Hank, what's going
on with this suit?

507
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:39,404
How much of a work
in progress is this?

508
00:35:40,186 --> 00:35:43,568
Uh-oh. Oh, no.
No, no, no.

509
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:57,911
What, are you laughing?
Please, can you just...

510
00:35:57,936 --> 00:35:59,193
Okay. Okay.

511
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,167
What do you see?

512
00:36:04,183 --> 00:36:06,237
The sizing coils are
malfunctioning.

513
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:07,394
Just let me...

514
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,972
Oww!

515
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:13,151
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

516
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,120
Okay.

517
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:18,011
All right.

518
00:36:18,324 --> 00:36:20,011
Try it now.

519
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:24,462
So...

520
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:31,591
Awesome.

521
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,809
If only Cap could see you now.

522
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,051
Hilarious. What are we gonna do?

523
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:47,689
Hey!

524
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,947
Where's your hall pass?

525
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:53,643
Hey, I'm talking to you.

526
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:55,729
Hey!

527
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:58,135
Hey...

528
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,115
You can do it. You
almost got it!

529
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,116
Oh, Peanut.

530
00:37:53,616 --> 00:37:55,514
Okay. Let's go.

531
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:13,062
Hiya, Champ! How
was school today?

532
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:15,928
Hahaha. Alright, get
your jokes out now.

533
00:38:15,953 --> 00:38:18,467
- Can you fix the suit?
- He's so cranky.

534
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:21,432
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

535
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,870
Do you really have that?

536
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:35,321
Let's see if Foster was right.

537
00:38:47,712 --> 00:38:49,977
This has got to be the lab.

538
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:55,985
- Let's go get it.
- Yeah.

539
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:06,464
This seems right.

540
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:10,988
Look at us. Teaming
up twice in one day.

541
00:39:11,097 --> 00:39:12,620
Makes you think, huh?

542
00:39:12,652 --> 00:39:15,269
- About what?
- Germany?

543
00:39:15,597 --> 00:39:18,456
- What do you mean?
- We were working together.

544
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:22,284
Training together. And,
other stuff-ing together.

545
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:24,668
If I'd have asked you,
would you have come?

546
00:39:24,715 --> 00:39:27,965
I guess we'll never know.
But I do know one thing.

547
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,949
What?

548
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:31,973
If I had, you'd have
never been caught.

549
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:41,122
Hey, Scott.

550
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:45,184
You think you can stop daydreaming about
my daughter long enough to get my lab?

551
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:47,466
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

552
00:39:52,572 --> 00:39:54,570
Okay. You're transmitting.

553
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:56,008
What took you so long?

554
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:57,999
Sorry, I had to come up
with a name for my ant.

555
00:39:58,024 --> 00:40:01,242
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

556
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,313
- Like it?
- Hilarious.

557
00:40:04,274 --> 00:40:08,664
I'm not getting anything on the monitors.
There's some kind of electronic disturbance.

558
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:10,507
- Be careful.
- You know me, Hank.

559
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:12,617
I'm always care--- Whoa!

560
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:14,992
- It's okay. It's just a suit.
- How do you know?

561
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:16,146
Look.

562
00:40:19,341 --> 00:40:21,029
That's Ghost?

563
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:22,574
What is she doing?

564
00:40:22,614 --> 00:40:25,520
You think that suit is how she
goes through walls and stuff?

565
00:40:25,552 --> 00:40:27,472
Let's just get out of
here before she wakes up.

566
00:40:27,497 --> 00:40:30,567
Hope, look. There's the lab.

567
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:38,815
We're sure this is our shrunken building
and not somebody else's, right?

568
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,229
Just take it, Scott.
We gotta be fast.

569
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,612
I'll get it.

570
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:45,948
Oh, sh...

571
00:40:58,767 --> 00:40:59,828
Hope.

572
00:40:59,853 --> 00:41:01,235
Hank.

573
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,688
Guys?

574
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:05,407
I don't think they can hear you.

575
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:09,181
Hi.

576
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,351
I'm Ava.

577
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,999
Scott.

578
00:41:13,273 --> 00:41:14,515
So...

579
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:18,512
You don't need a suit to, uhh...
You know.

580
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,059
Go through things.

581
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:22,473
No.

582
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,856
It just helps me control it.

583
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,465
And the pain. Supposedly.

584
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,716
You're not gonna reach into my
chest and crush my heart, are you?

585
00:41:42,743 --> 00:41:44,680
You're funny.

586
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:50,422
I'm not gonna hurt you
Scott, unless I have to.

587
00:41:52,688 --> 00:41:54,243
I need...

588
00:41:55,857 --> 00:41:57,724
What's in your head.

589
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:15,028
Let's wake up the rest of the gang
and get this over with, shall we?

590
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:20,278
Get up! Come on!

591
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,708
Dad?

592
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:28,286
Don't ever touch him again.

593
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:30,192
Now, now, Hope...

594
00:42:30,263 --> 00:42:34,153
I think I'm being rather gentle with
your Father, all things considered.

595
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,060
What the hell are
you talking about?

596
00:42:37,252 --> 00:42:40,292
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

597
00:42:42,097 --> 00:42:43,307
Bill.

598
00:42:44,573 --> 00:42:46,315
What have you done?

599
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:49,432
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.

600
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:51,026
You with her?

601
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:53,526
Aw, man. I thought
you were cool.

602
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,331
What the hell is going on here?

603
00:42:55,386 --> 00:43:00,448
I doubt Hank have ever mentioned my Father.
Why would he?

604
00:43:00,597 --> 00:43:02,807
Elihas Starr.

605
00:43:03,152 --> 00:43:05,620
They were colleagues at SHIELD.

606
00:43:05,738 --> 00:43:07,868
Quantum research.

607
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:12,485
Until my Father dared to disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

608
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:17,243
You had him fired. Oh, and
discredited for good measure.

609
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:24,015
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

610
00:43:24,826 --> 00:43:28,685
Desperate to restore his
name, so he took risks.

611
00:43:28,764 --> 00:43:29,764
No!

612
00:43:30,123 --> 00:43:31,857
Too many.

613
00:43:32,303 --> 00:43:34,690
Until something went wrong.

614
00:43:35,185 --> 00:43:36,771
He told us to run.

615
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:39,605
- Elihas, what's happening?
- Just go. Go!

616
00:43:39,675 --> 00:43:40,754
Daddy!

617
00:43:41,206 --> 00:43:43,792
I can tell he was scared.

618
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:50,880
- Daddy!
- Ava, no!

619
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:56,497
I didn't want him to be alone.

620
00:43:57,412 --> 00:43:59,669
No! No!

621
00:44:06,131 --> 00:44:08,842
When I woke up, my
parents were dead.

622
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,154
I wasn't so lucky.

623
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:21,719
They call it "Molecular
Disequilibrium."

624
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:24,026
A rather dull name, I think.

625
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:27,113
Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.

626
00:44:27,426 --> 00:44:33,441
Every cell, in my body, is torn
apart and stitched back together.

627
00:44:33,691 --> 00:44:37,706
Over, and over, everyday.

628
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:41,323
I was still at SHIELD
when I got the call about a

629
00:44:41,347 --> 00:44:44,268
"quantum anomaly" in Argentina.

630
00:44:46,828 --> 00:44:48,508
Hello, Ava.

631
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:50,937
My name is Bill.

632
00:44:51,164 --> 00:44:53,656
I was a friend of your Father's.

633
00:44:54,746 --> 00:44:56,964
I brought you something.

634
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:03,151
It's all right. Try again.

635
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:05,745
That's it.

636
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:08,901
Dr. Foster did his
best to keep me safe.

637
00:45:09,518 --> 00:45:13,744
But others at SHIELD saw an
opportunity in my affliction.

638
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:20,799
They built me a containment suit
so I can control my phasing.

639
00:45:21,112 --> 00:45:23,932
And trained me to be
a stealth operative.

640
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,057
They weaponized me.

641
00:45:26,322 --> 00:45:29,157
I stole for them,
spied for them...

642
00:45:29,182 --> 00:45:31,518
I killed for them.

643
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,026
And in exchange for my soul,

644
00:45:34,058 --> 00:45:36,440
they were going to cure me.

645
00:45:39,026 --> 00:45:40,526
They lied.

646
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:44,612
When SHIELD collapsed,
I took Ava in.

647
00:45:44,651 --> 00:45:47,590
I built the chamber to slow
her decay, but her condition

648
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:50,088
was progressive. I didn't
know how to cure her.

649
00:45:50,705 --> 00:45:53,580
She wanted to kill you, Hank.
But I told her, no.

650
00:45:53,596 --> 00:45:55,798
And that she should watch you instead.
And sure enough,

651
00:45:55,822 --> 00:45:58,861
she discovered that you
were building a tunnel.

652
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:02,088
Then she told me about Lang.

653
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:06,303
And the message from
Janet inside his head...

654
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:08,554
- For Christ's sake!
- That's me. I'm sorry.

655
00:46:08,578 --> 00:46:10,968
Look, can you tell
me who's texting me?

656
00:46:11,408 --> 00:46:13,351
Cassie. 911.

657
00:46:13,376 --> 00:46:15,556
That's my daughter. I
need to text her back.

658
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:16,844
No. That's not happening.

659
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:18,704
It's 911. That means
it's an emergency!

660
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:20,642
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

661
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,374
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

662
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:26,788
Okay, well, she's trying to videochat
me now. Something might be wrong.

663
00:46:26,813 --> 00:46:28,773
Let me talk to her. Please!

664
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:32,828
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

665
00:46:32,934 --> 00:46:35,613
- I can't find my soccer shoes.
- What?

666
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:37,035
I have a game tomorrow.

667
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,366
Hey, Scott, I know
that they're there.

668
00:46:38,391 --> 00:46:39,698
Can you just walk the
phone around the house?

669
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:42,348
- No, I can't do that right now.
- Why not?

670
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:43,277
Because I'm sick.

671
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:47,097
Hey, can you just maybe look around later
then call me back? Please? Thank you.

672
00:46:47,106 --> 00:46:49,324
- Bye, Daddy!
- Bye, Peanut!

673
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,808
- Feel better!
- Feel better, buddy!

674
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:54,504
I'm sorry. It's
that emergency.

675
00:46:54,629 --> 00:46:56,386
Ava, I wanna help you.

676
00:46:56,395 --> 00:46:58,472
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

677
00:46:58,497 --> 00:47:00,951
- Oh, really? How?
- Janet.

678
00:47:00,998 --> 00:47:03,935
For the last 30 years, she's been
down there absorbing quantum energy.

679
00:47:03,993 --> 00:47:07,754
We can extract that energy. We can use it
to repair Ava's molecular structure...

680
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:08,946
- Extract it?
- Yes!

681
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,304
Are you insane? That
would rip Janet apart!

682
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:15,009
You don't know that. I'm
gonna fire up your tunnel.

683
00:47:15,063 --> 00:47:17,616
When Janet's location pops into Lang's
head, he's gonna give it to me,

684
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:20,571
- or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.
- What?

685
00:47:20,618 --> 00:47:24,563
You're gonna stay here just
in case I need your help.

686
00:47:25,497 --> 00:47:28,106
- Like hell, I would help you!
- You'll do whatever I say.

687
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,230
- You're gonna kill Janet.
- I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.

688
00:47:31,255 --> 00:47:33,700
Goddammit, Bill!

689
00:47:34,224 --> 00:47:36,333
- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.

690
00:47:36,372 --> 00:47:38,544
So help me, God...

691
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:41,840
It's his heart! He needs
his pills, please.

692
00:47:41,872 --> 00:47:44,590
Dr. Foster, they're
in the tin, please.

693
00:47:45,286 --> 00:47:48,051
He could die! For... come on!

694
00:47:48,207 --> 00:47:49,402
Help him!

695
00:47:49,512 --> 00:47:52,222
Dad, just hang on, alright?
Just keep breathing. Stay calm.

696
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:55,730
- Help him, man! Come on!
- The Altoid tin!

697
00:47:57,443 --> 00:47:58,738
Wait!

698
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:03,997
Thanks, guys!

699
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:05,591
Hank!

700
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:19,699
Bill is filling that
girl's head with lies.

701
00:48:19,724 --> 00:48:23,005
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

702
00:48:23,073 --> 00:48:25,440
Now, bring her down.
Right, lock it in.

703
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:28,330
No, no, no. The bolt
is on the other side.

704
00:48:28,346 --> 00:48:31,166
Tighten that one down, then
bring her down with one knock.

705
00:48:31,315 --> 00:48:33,627
- Good job.
- It'll work.

706
00:48:33,682 --> 00:48:35,963
Foster, he could've fried
the entire system.

707
00:48:35,992 --> 00:48:39,026
Look, we'll adjust the relays while you
go reprogram the settings. All right?

708
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:40,695
It's gonna be fine.

709
00:48:46,461 --> 00:48:48,726
- So, this is it.
- Yeah.

710
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:51,328
You'd think with all this time
to prepare, I'd be more ready.

711
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:54,367
Well, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

712
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,203
It kind of, melts your mind.

713
00:48:57,266 --> 00:49:00,125
- I mean, seeing my Mom again.
- Oh.

714
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,390
What if she's a completely
different person?

715
00:49:04,407 --> 00:49:06,968
Yeah, like George Washington?

716
00:49:06,992 --> 00:49:11,195
- I'm serious, Scott.
- Or, George Jefferson?

717
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:15,171
What if she's
forgotten about me?

718
00:49:15,836 --> 00:49:17,906
When I was in prison...

719
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:20,413
The only thing that got
me through was Cassie.

720
00:49:20,453 --> 00:49:24,124
I could've been locked up for 100 years.
I never would've forgotten her.

721
00:49:25,448 --> 00:49:29,339
I know your Mom is counting the
minutes until she can see you again.

722
00:49:31,316 --> 00:49:32,722
Thank you.

723
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:42,256
- Hey.
- We've got a big problem.

724
00:49:42,335 --> 00:49:45,108
You forgot the motion sensor lights
on the back of the building.

725
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:45,717
No.

726
00:49:45,742 --> 00:49:49,360
They're on the proposal, and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

727
00:49:49,385 --> 00:49:52,773
Uh, yeah. Look, it's
been a little crazy...

728
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:55,494
Look, maybe I can stop by
tomorrow and take a look at it.

729
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:56,560
No, no, no, no!

730
00:49:56,585 --> 00:49:59,191
The meeting is first thing in the morning.
You gotta come right now and fix it.

731
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:01,723
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

732
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,309
You know what, I'm coming to you.
I'll just explain the plans, and

733
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,778
get it on the laptop, and
you can fix them in.

734
00:50:06,927 --> 00:50:09,145
- Just tell me where you are, okay?
- It's complicated.

735
00:50:09,177 --> 00:50:11,591
What do you mean,
it's complicated?

736
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,505
As you can see, sir...

737
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:19,004
This system is state-of-the-art.

738
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:21,208
Security of tomorrow... today!

739
00:50:21,247 --> 00:50:24,278
Oh, that's so good! I love the
lead-in, Bro. Keep practicing.

740
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,552
Hey, I just gotta drive on to
Scotty's, so he can fix the plans.

741
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:28,262
But don't worry. I'll be
back in plenty of time.

742
00:50:28,304 --> 00:50:29,117
As you can see, sir...

743
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:30,679
Oh! Oh! Oh!

744
00:50:31,353 --> 00:50:32,876
Tell me you got the van
washed for tomorrow morning.

745
00:50:32,892 --> 00:50:34,562
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

746
00:50:34,587 --> 00:50:37,502
- You sprung for the undercarriage wash?
- Well, you said get the works.

747
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,765
That's a scam, Bro. We live in
California, not Minnesota!

748
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,125
He's right.

749
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,666
The undercarriage wash.

750
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,602
That's for cleaning
off road salt.

751
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:48,553
Laid out in all those
snow-laden sister states.

752
00:50:48,616 --> 00:50:51,443
Who are you and why do you know
so much about car wash protocol?

753
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,037
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

754
00:50:54,061 --> 00:50:56,537
And I do my research, Luis.

755
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:01,246
To wit, I have learned,
from a friend of mine,

756
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:04,927
at the FBI, that you're a
known associate of Scott Lang.

757
00:51:04,953 --> 00:51:08,046
A known associate of Hank Pym.
Who I've also learned,

758
00:51:08,072 --> 00:51:12,900
has a portable frickin' laboratory.
Filled with all kinds of juicy tech.

759
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,689
And you're gonna
tell me where it is.

760
00:51:16,218 --> 00:51:19,663
Well, I hate to break it to you, but I
don't know what you're talking about.

761
00:51:20,712 --> 00:51:22,788
Well, I sense a
resistance in you, Luis.

762
00:51:22,851 --> 00:51:26,093
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

763
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:30,538
So, I'm gonna introduce you,
to my good friend Uzman.

764
00:51:30,843 --> 00:51:34,124
Now, Uzman, is a master

765
00:51:34,202 --> 00:51:38,795
at extracting information from the
unwillin' through psychoactive means.

766
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,010
Oh, is that truth serum?

767
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:44,252
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

768
00:51:44,277 --> 00:51:46,277
That's just nonsense from TV.

769
00:51:46,332 --> 00:51:48,995
- What is it, then?
- It's a little concoction,

770
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:52,137
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the SIS.

771
00:51:52,162 --> 00:51:55,175
It makes you suggestible.
And highly responsive.

772
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:57,136
- Dude, that's truth serum!
- No, it's not.

773
00:51:57,152 --> 00:51:58,790
No fencing, but,

774
00:51:58,853 --> 00:52:00,805
- this sound like truth serum to me.
- Right?!

775
00:52:00,852 --> 00:52:04,109
- It's not a truth serum.
- Oh, okay. Hey, I believe you.

776
00:52:04,149 --> 00:52:05,601
It's not a truth serum.

777
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:08,813
If it walk like duck,
and talk like ducks...

778
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:10,063
It's truth serum.

779
00:52:10,095 --> 00:52:12,351
Well, I have a lot of allergies.
So...

780
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:14,711
You might wanna
think about that.

781
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,251
Time to get that lab back.

782
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:20,836
What?

783
00:52:21,673 --> 00:52:24,969
The chamber and the suit are
barely helping anymore.

784
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:28,172
How long have I got?

785
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:32,889
A couple of weeks, maybe.

786
00:52:34,616 --> 00:52:37,029
Well then, we'll make
them bring the lab back.

787
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:38,155
How?

788
00:52:39,194 --> 00:52:41,507
Lang. He has a daughter, right?

789
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:43,944
You can't mean that. Ava?

790
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:48,182
I tolerate a lot of the
things you do out there,

791
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,567
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

792
00:52:50,621 --> 00:52:53,636
You're not the one who's about
to fade away into nothing, Bill.

793
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:54,949
I am!

794
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,542
You said you could fix me.

795
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,473
You promised!

796
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,942
I know. I will.

797
00:53:04,091 --> 00:53:05,770
But not like that.

798
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:10,106
You let one finger on
that little girl...

799
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,262
I won't help you.
And we're done.

800
00:53:18,422 --> 00:53:19,609
Fine.

801
00:53:21,063 --> 00:53:23,687
There are other options.

802
00:53:36,817 --> 00:53:39,192
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

803
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:40,425
'Cause I don't feel anything.

804
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,450
That was a lie. I
did feel something.

805
00:53:42,575 --> 00:53:44,629
- This is truth serum!
- There's no such thing.

806
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:45,989
Okay!

807
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,278
Okay, okay.

808
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,193
Now I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

809
00:53:51,209 --> 00:53:52,372
Okay.

810
00:53:54,654 --> 00:53:55,841
Where...

811
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,997
is Scott Lang?

812
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:01,488
Well, see, that's complicated. 'Cause when
I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place.

813
00:54:01,534 --> 00:54:04,399
And I'm not talking about cell block D.
His wife had just filed for divorce.

814
00:54:04,424 --> 00:54:06,744
And I was like, "Damn, homie, she
dumped you while you were in lock-up?"

815
00:54:06,773 --> 00:54:08,860
And he's like, "Yeah, I know. I thought
I was gonna be with her forever,

816
00:54:08,885 --> 00:54:09,885
but now, I'm all alone!"

817
00:54:09,898 --> 00:54:12,514
And I was like, "Damn, homie, you gotta
chin up. 'Cause you'll find a new partner.

818
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:13,882
But you know what? I'm Luis."

819
00:54:13,898 --> 00:54:16,304
And he says, "You know what? I'm Scotty.
And we're gonna be best friends."

820
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:17,351
Wait, hold on, hold on.

821
00:54:17,392 --> 00:54:21,258
Now I like a good story as much as the next person,
but what's this have to do with where Scott Lang is?

822
00:54:21,282 --> 00:54:22,556
I'm getting there,
I'm getting there.

823
00:54:22,581 --> 00:54:25,352
You put a dime in him, you got
to let the whole song play out.

824
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:27,229
He hit like human jukebox.

825
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:29,220
Oh! My abuelita had a
jukebox in a restaurant.

826
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:31,252
Yeah. Only played Morrissey.

827
00:54:31,308 --> 00:54:34,315
And if anybody ever complained,
she'd be like, "Oh, porque? Gusta mas?"

828
00:54:34,324 --> 00:54:36,583
And El Chicanos, we call
them mas, "then, adios!"

829
00:54:36,608 --> 00:54:39,764
What can I say? We relate to these
melancholy bandits, you know?

830
00:54:39,789 --> 00:54:41,350
- Lang.
- Right, right, right, right.

831
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:43,195
So anyway, this guy gets out of
jail and starts working for Hank.

832
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,217
And that's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all like,

833
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:47,693
"I want nothing to do with you. Look
at my hairdo. I'm all business."

834
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:48,741
And then Scotty's like,

835
00:54:48,757 --> 00:54:51,608
"You know what, girl? My heart's all broken,
and I'll probably never find love again.

836
00:54:51,632 --> 00:54:52,687
But damn, if I
want to kiss you!"

837
00:54:52,712 --> 00:54:54,849
But then you fast-forward and they're
all like into each other, right?

838
00:54:54,873 --> 00:54:57,232
And then Scotty's like, "You know
what, I can't tell you this,

839
00:54:57,255 --> 00:54:59,099
but I'm gonna go trashing the
airport with Captain America!"

840
00:54:59,114 --> 00:55:02,294
Then she said, "I can't believe you split
like that! Smell you later, dummy!"

841
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,589
So Scotty goes on house arrest, and he
won't admit it, but his heart's all like,

842
00:55:05,614 --> 00:55:08,755
"Damn! I thought Hope could've been
my new true partner. But I blew it!"

843
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,319
But fate brought them back together,
and then Hope's heart is all,

844
00:55:11,343 --> 00:55:14,476
"I'm worried that I can't trust him. And he's
gonna screw up again and ruin everything."

845
00:55:14,483 --> 00:55:16,193
And in my heart, it's all like,

846
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:19,942
"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's rent.
And we're days away from going out of business! Oooh!"

847
00:55:19,967 --> 00:55:21,802
- Out of business?
- Days away?!

848
00:55:21,842 --> 00:55:24,420
Damn truth serum! I was
trying to protect you guys.

849
00:55:24,428 --> 00:55:27,256
I swear to God. I was trying to
be a good boss. But we're broke.

850
00:55:27,287 --> 00:55:29,490
And the Karapetyans are our last hope,
and if we don't show up, we're done!

851
00:55:29,514 --> 00:55:31,279
- That's terrible bossing.
- Damn, Bro!

852
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:33,388
- That's on me. That's on me!
- Hey!

853
00:55:33,841 --> 00:55:35,192
Enough.

854
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:40,256
I'm gonna ask you
one more time...

855
00:55:41,161 --> 00:55:42,370
Where is Scott Lang?

856
00:55:42,395 --> 00:55:44,262
I've been trying to tell you. He's in
a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.

857
00:55:44,278 --> 00:55:45,918
Emotionally speaking.

858
00:55:46,121 --> 00:55:49,245
But where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking?!

859
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:50,699
Oh! The woods.

860
00:55:50,746 --> 00:55:52,191
The woods?

861
00:55:52,277 --> 00:55:53,706
Baba Yaga!

862
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,254
What do you mean, the woods?

863
00:55:56,293 --> 00:55:59,089
The Muir woods!

864
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,606
For God's sake!

865
00:56:01,668 --> 00:56:06,363
Baba Yaga, coming late, little
children, sleep at eight.

866
00:56:09,428 --> 00:56:10,961
Damn it!

867
00:56:11,936 --> 00:56:14,685
If that freak gets Pym's tech,
I'm never gonna see it.

868
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:16,959
So what do we do now?

869
00:56:17,491 --> 00:56:20,693
It's easier to steal it from the
feds than from a boogeyman.

870
00:56:22,928 --> 00:56:24,248
Hey. It's me.

871
00:56:24,264 --> 00:56:26,029
How'd you like to
get a promotion?

872
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:29,818
I've got the location on
Pym, Van Dyne, and Lang.

873
00:56:30,029 --> 00:56:32,998
But you're gonna have to take them down now,
'cause they ain't gonna be there for long.

874
00:56:33,296 --> 00:56:35,803
And when you do, you're
gonna get me that lab.

875
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,436
Understood.

876
00:56:38,882 --> 00:56:40,710
Good news, gentlemen.

877
00:56:40,784 --> 00:56:43,268
Feds are gonna do the
hard work for us.

878
00:56:43,643 --> 00:56:46,057
What are you looking at?
Change my tire!

879
00:56:48,128 --> 00:56:49,252
Sir...

880
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:51,245
Can you knock?

881
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:54,456
Sorry, sir. But I
just got a lead.

882
00:56:55,269 --> 00:56:57,385
Ooh. I love leads.

883
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:07,047
- Systems in the green.
- Priming the coils.

884
00:57:09,383 --> 00:57:10,617
Full charge.

885
00:57:10,758 --> 00:57:13,836
Soon as the tunnel's open, let us know if you
get anything that could be part of her message.

886
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:15,375
Yeah, yeah. I will.

887
00:57:17,196 --> 00:57:18,672
Okay, then.

888
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,617
Here it goes.

889
00:57:36,588 --> 00:57:38,173
We did it!

890
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,884
You got anything?

891
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:44,572
Nothing.

892
00:57:44,947 --> 00:57:47,603
Just give it a minute.
Because it could...

893
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,666
No. No, no, no!

894
00:57:51,736 --> 00:57:54,384
- What's happening?
- It's shutting down. Maybe vectors are off.

895
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:56,651
We've gone over them a million times.
I know they're right.

896
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:59,385
- Well then, what else could it be?
- I don't know.

897
00:58:05,755 --> 00:58:07,481
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!

898
00:58:07,505 --> 00:58:08,473
Scott, we had...

899
00:58:08,497 --> 00:58:12,090
I'm sorry. I don't know how much time
I have. I need to fix the algorithm.

900
00:58:13,575 --> 00:58:15,957
Trust me, after 30
years down here...

901
00:58:16,115 --> 00:58:18,403
I've thought about it a lot.

902
00:58:22,342 --> 00:58:23,646
Janet?

903
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:27,756
Hi, Hon.

904
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,844
Hello, Jellybean.

905
00:58:33,095 --> 00:58:34,290
Mom?

906
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:38,883
It's not the reunion I had
imagined. It's all so rushed.

907
00:58:39,001 --> 00:58:41,188
You two have done
such great work.

908
00:58:41,235 --> 00:58:43,641
You just need
a little...

909
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:45,641
nudge.

910
00:58:59,571 --> 00:59:02,422
Janet, how is
this possible?

911
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,555
It wasn't a message you put in
Scott's head. It was an antenna.

912
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:09,391
Clever girl.

913
00:59:09,493 --> 00:59:11,398
I'm so proud of you.

914
00:59:11,594 --> 00:59:15,023
Honey, tell us where you are.
Tell us how to find you.

915
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:18,750
No, the probability fields are too complex.
That's why I needed to talk to you.

916
00:59:18,852 --> 00:59:20,812
You have to
follow my voice.

917
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:23,837
- Of course.
- Like tracing a call back to its source.

918
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:31,691
I'm tracking your signal using
subatomic frequencies,

919
00:59:31,746 --> 00:59:34,152
between point
2 and point 9.

920
00:59:34,177 --> 00:59:36,982
- I've narrowed it to 4 and 6.
- It's too tight. We could miss you.

921
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:39,778
Look at us squabbling again.

922
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,717
Fine. Between 3 and 7.

923
00:59:42,742 --> 00:59:46,411
Our first fight in decades
and it's over just like that.

924
01:00:01,587 --> 01:00:02,993
Bull's eye.

925
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,680
- Source lock.
- It's you!

926
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:08,110
Ha! We got it!

927
01:00:08,446 --> 01:00:10,704
You have to meet me in
these exact coordinates.

928
01:00:10,728 --> 01:00:13,267
In the wasteland, beyond
the quantum void.

929
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:16,765
It's very dangerous, especially on
the human mind. So be careful.

930
01:00:16,835 --> 01:00:19,553
Time and space work
very differently down here.

931
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:22,419
You have two hours. After that,
the probability fields will shift,

932
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:25,451
and it'll be another century
before they'll align like this again.

933
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:27,615
We'll find you.

934
01:00:34,066 --> 01:00:36,355
I know you
will, Jellybean.

935
01:00:40,832 --> 01:00:41,972
Nope.

936
01:00:42,451 --> 01:00:45,880
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

937
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,755
How did we get up here?

938
01:00:54,185 --> 01:00:56,941
At first, you'll see all kinds of lights,
and it's gonna get really trippy

939
01:00:56,966 --> 01:00:59,989
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Like, really silent.

940
01:01:00,013 --> 01:01:01,466
Scott, I'll be fine.

941
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,678
- I'm just saying. Cause I've been down there.
- Yeah, so you've mentioned.

942
01:01:07,686 --> 01:01:10,491
Um, sorry. I have
to take this.

943
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:12,272
Hey, man. You coming?

944
01:01:12,288 --> 01:01:14,233
No, I'm not. But you
know what? Ghost is.

945
01:01:14,249 --> 01:01:16,475
And you know what? The
feds, they know where you are.

946
01:01:16,514 --> 01:01:17,998
- What?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

947
01:01:18,124 --> 01:01:21,139
They gave me some truth serum, then all
of a sudden I started talking all honestly,

948
01:01:21,155 --> 01:01:24,631
like, I hate the way that you
use the dishwasher. I hate it.

949
01:01:24,787 --> 01:01:27,201
But you need to go home because
the feds are probably going there now!

950
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:30,084
And by the way, who puts the
plates on the top rack, okay?

951
01:01:30,108 --> 01:01:31,818
They don't go there!

952
01:01:40,135 --> 01:01:41,642
I feel like
such a jerk.

953
01:01:41,674 --> 01:01:44,892
You're gonna be really
mad. We gotta go.

954
01:01:44,932 --> 01:01:46,799
- What?
- Ghost knows where we are.

955
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:48,721
- So does the FBI.
- How?

956
01:01:48,753 --> 01:01:50,862
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?

957
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:53,363
I told him to come here, so I can help
him with the Karapetyan proposal.

958
01:01:53,379 --> 01:01:54,558
Oh, my God!

959
01:01:54,606 --> 01:01:58,097
But... Look, we need to land that account.
Otherwise, we'll lose the business!

960
01:01:58,113 --> 01:02:00,103
Do you know how hard it is for ex-
cons to find work these days?

961
01:02:00,128 --> 01:02:02,183
Jesus, Scott!

962
01:02:11,196 --> 01:02:12,899
90 seconds to
close the aperture.

963
01:02:12,924 --> 01:02:15,511
- You have to depolarize the coils first.
- I know.

964
01:02:15,536 --> 01:02:17,731
I'm really sorry, but the...

965
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,528
FBI is coming
to my place, so...

966
01:02:20,724 --> 01:02:22,708
I have to go.

967
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:26,245
Can I borrow the suit?

968
01:02:28,793 --> 01:02:32,214
Look, uhh... I'm just
gonna borrow the suit.

969
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:34,847
I'll come back. Just
tell me where you'll be.

970
01:02:34,863 --> 01:02:36,323
- Don't bother.
- What?

971
01:02:36,355 --> 01:02:38,894
We'll come and get the suit from
you as soon as we find my Mom.

972
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:41,682
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!

973
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:00,582
- Scott?
- Daddy?

974
01:03:00,606 --> 01:03:04,238
- It's us, buddy!
- We're here for Cassie's shoes.

975
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:05,668
He must be resting.

976
01:03:05,684 --> 01:03:08,104
Honey, why don't you go up the
stairs and go look under your bed.

977
01:03:08,129 --> 01:03:11,097
Daddy? You upstairs?

978
01:03:11,293 --> 01:03:12,933
Daddy...

979
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,003
What the?

980
01:03:16,467 --> 01:03:19,741
Really lives like
a pig these days.

981
01:03:22,124 --> 01:03:23,467
Daddy?

982
01:03:30,822 --> 01:03:32,853
Spread out!

983
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,657
- Again?
- You people have no shame!

984
01:03:35,705 --> 01:03:39,080
- The monitor says that he's in the bathroom.
- Yeah. I'm not buying it.

985
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:43,220
Cassie, let
the man get by.

986
01:03:43,245 --> 01:03:45,672
- But Daddy's super sick!
- I'll see about that.

987
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:47,689
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick.

988
01:03:47,714 --> 01:03:49,854
Well, I'll take my
chances, sweetie.

989
01:03:49,878 --> 01:03:52,167
He barfed. Like, a lot.

990
01:03:52,183 --> 01:03:55,831
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.
I've seen worse things than vomit.

991
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,549
- Like, a lot, a lot?
- Yes!

992
01:03:58,604 --> 01:04:01,096
- Forget it. Move aside.
- No!

993
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:07,272
Woo!

994
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:10,498
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.

995
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:14,373
I'm sorry. I'm just really sick.

996
01:04:14,537 --> 01:04:16,037
I told you.

997
01:04:16,357 --> 01:04:19,521
Excuse me. Sometimes you
just gotta get it out, you know?

998
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:21,116
Sorry.

999
01:04:27,649 --> 01:04:31,407
I'll start the van.
You get the lab.

1000
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:37,179
Freeze! You're surrounded!

1001
01:04:50,057 --> 01:04:55,206
Hank Pym. Hope Van Dyne.
You're under arrest.

1002
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,611
- This is harassment.
- Actually, it's not.

1003
01:04:58,713 --> 01:05:02,705
What does the FBI even stand for?
Forever Bothering Individuals?

1004
01:05:04,127 --> 01:05:06,923
- His monitor check out?
- Of course, it does.

1005
01:05:07,065 --> 01:05:10,314
Damn it. It's like I just got
fed a bowl of malarkey.

1006
01:05:10,963 --> 01:05:13,509
We got them, sir. Pym and
Van Dyne are in custody.

1007
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:16,025
Seriously? Yes!

1008
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,790
Oh. Sorry, Scott. They were
your friends. That's insensitive.

1009
01:05:20,931 --> 01:05:23,532
I just really needed a
win, you know? Anyway...

1010
01:05:23,564 --> 01:05:27,854
I'll be back later for the official end of your
sentence. Sorry for misjudging you, pal.

1011
01:05:27,879 --> 01:05:30,582
You should feel
great about yourself.

1012
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:54,543
What is it?

1013
01:05:54,568 --> 01:05:57,526
We have a man down,
and Pym's lab is gone.

1014
01:06:05,634 --> 01:06:06,938
Hey.

1015
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,954
- Thanks for covering for me.
- Sure.

1016
01:06:14,439 --> 01:06:15,439
So..

1017
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:18,672
How long have you
been Ant-Man again?

1018
01:06:22,509 --> 01:06:23,891
Not long.

1019
01:06:24,094 --> 01:06:25,781
Things just sort
of happened.

1020
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:29,780
I'm sorry, for lying to you. I'm
sorry for risking everything.

1021
01:06:29,805 --> 01:06:32,375
- Dad, it's okay.
- That's not...

1022
01:06:33,258 --> 01:06:37,250
I do some dumb things, and the people
that I love the most pay the price.

1023
01:06:37,305 --> 01:06:38,328
Mainly, you.

1024
01:06:38,353 --> 01:06:40,703
Trying to help
people isn't dumb.

1025
01:06:40,759 --> 01:06:42,001
Well...

1026
01:06:42,892 --> 01:06:45,337
I screw it up just
about every time.

1027
01:06:45,362 --> 01:06:48,532
So maybe, you just need
someone watching your back.

1028
01:06:48,603 --> 01:06:49,931
Like a partner.

1029
01:06:49,955 --> 01:06:52,524
Well, she's made it clear that's
about the last thing she wants.

1030
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:54,837
- Who?
- Hope.

1031
01:06:57,677 --> 01:07:00,286
- What, who did you think?
- Me.

1032
01:07:00,326 --> 01:07:01,724
You?

1033
01:07:01,865 --> 01:07:03,544
Don't laugh.

1034
01:07:03,724 --> 01:07:07,207
- I'd be a great partner.
- Oh, Peanut!

1035
01:07:07,598 --> 01:07:09,879
You would be awesome.

1036
01:07:10,216 --> 01:07:13,622
And if I let you, I would
be a terrible Dad.

1037
01:07:14,005 --> 01:07:15,005
Fine.

1038
01:07:15,411 --> 01:07:18,520
Have Hope be your
partner. She's smart.

1039
01:07:20,005 --> 01:07:22,083
She reminds me of you.

1040
01:07:22,114 --> 01:07:24,348
You gonna go help her?

1041
01:07:24,443 --> 01:07:26,309
I think you should help her.

1042
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,856
I wish I could, but...

1043
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:32,317
I don't know how I can help
her without hurting you.

1044
01:07:35,454 --> 01:07:39,500
You can do it. You
can do anything.

1045
01:07:39,884 --> 01:07:42,805
You're the World's
Greatest Grandma.

1046
01:07:50,304 --> 01:07:51,983
Agent Woo will
see you in an hour.

1047
01:07:52,008 --> 01:07:54,279
An hour? We don't
have an hour.

1048
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:57,186
Aww. You got somewhere
else to be?

1049
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:07,093
Now, that's my girl.

1050
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:15,360
Alright, what's our plan?

1051
01:08:16,681 --> 01:08:18,415
To shrink that wall.

1052
01:08:18,579 --> 01:08:21,313
It looks load bearing.
Ceiling could collapse...

1053
01:08:21,337 --> 01:08:25,304
- Then we run like hell.
- It's made up of 15-20 agents on the floor.

1054
01:08:25,329 --> 01:08:27,321
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1055
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,180
- They're all heavily armed.
- Not great odds.

1056
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,165
- You got any better ideas?
- Nope.

1057
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,797
But I'm not giving
up on Mom.

1058
01:08:35,935 --> 01:08:38,208
She'd be so proud of you.

1059
01:08:42,989 --> 01:08:43,989
Okay.

1060
01:08:45,379 --> 01:08:46,379
One...

1061
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,511
Two...

1062
01:08:53,449 --> 01:08:54,402
Scott?

1063
01:08:54,427 --> 01:08:56,268
What are you two just
standing around for?

1064
01:08:56,293 --> 01:08:58,457
We gotta go
find that lab.

1065
01:08:58,559 --> 01:09:00,738
What about me?

1066
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:02,182
Perfect.

1067
01:09:02,394 --> 01:09:05,456
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1068
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,853
Sir.

1069
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:18,965
Okay. Now what?

1070
01:09:19,185 --> 01:09:21,044
You're asking me?

1071
01:09:23,146 --> 01:09:24,755
Get in!

1072
01:09:29,998 --> 01:09:30,998
Hi.

1073
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:32,708
Hi.

1074
01:09:35,076 --> 01:09:37,865
Uhh, excuse me. Are we
planning on leaving soon,

1075
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:42,546
or are you two gonna keep staring at each
other until they start shooting at us.

1076
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:50,315
- Hey, Burch.
- Yeah?

1077
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:53,496
- Yeah. They're out.
- I'm on my way.

1078
01:09:57,411 --> 01:10:00,231
- As soon as we see him, so was the van.
- How could this happen?

1079
01:10:00,256 --> 01:10:02,498
What the dickens?

1080
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:06,568
Thank you.

1081
01:10:06,654 --> 01:10:08,779
You're welcome.

1082
01:10:09,974 --> 01:10:12,154
So, uhh... How do
we find the lab?

1083
01:10:12,201 --> 01:10:16,552
After I lost it the first time,
I put on a new tracker...

1084
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:19,060
...of sorts.

1085
01:10:27,305 --> 01:10:29,383
That'll work.

1086
01:10:55,394 --> 01:10:57,440
Is it ready or not?

1087
01:10:57,558 --> 01:11:00,417
We can begin the
extraction process now.

1088
01:11:01,206 --> 01:11:04,651
Listen, Ava, this whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1089
01:11:04,895 --> 01:11:08,598
- Maybe, maybe we should...
- Maybe we should what? Wait?

1090
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:11,848
I've got days until I'm dead.

1091
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:16,016
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

1092
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,860
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1093
01:11:20,922 --> 01:11:23,641
We don't have much time before Mom's
location shifts and we lose her.

1094
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,172
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before that.

1095
01:11:26,477 --> 01:11:29,608
You know, my Pap-pap always said if you
wanna do something right, you make a list.

1096
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:30,977
So, we should do that.

1097
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,281
One, we have to
break into that lab.

1098
01:11:33,313 --> 01:11:35,961
Two, we have to kick
out Foster and Ghost.

1099
01:11:36,127 --> 01:11:39,961
Three, we have to fight Ghost. That
seems like it should be part of 2.

1100
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:42,392
2-A. Right? Let's call it 2-A.

1101
01:11:42,408 --> 01:11:44,322
Fight Ghost, 2-A. Oh!

1102
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:48,072
Also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully
grown for you to come back. Otherwise we're screwed...

1103
01:11:48,088 --> 01:11:48,712
Scott...

1104
01:11:48,728 --> 01:11:50,087
You want me to start
again? I'll start again.

1105
01:11:50,111 --> 01:11:52,095
I'm going to dive.

1106
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:56,268
The only chance we've got is if
the 2 of you are out here

1107
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:59,532
together, protecting the tunnel.

1108
01:11:59,654 --> 01:12:02,529
Let me do this,
Hope. Please.

1109
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:05,763
Let me get her.

1110
01:12:07,093 --> 01:12:08,827
I think he's right.

1111
01:12:16,051 --> 01:12:18,277
Whassup?

1112
01:12:20,864 --> 01:12:23,559
You remember that
beloved commercial?

1113
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:25,863
Whassup?

1114
01:12:25,957 --> 01:12:27,855
I had him follow us here.

1115
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:30,691
I thought we could
use some help.

1116
01:12:32,285 --> 01:12:35,222
All right. I'm in position.
The ants are headed in.

1117
01:12:35,262 --> 01:12:37,957
- Copy that.
- Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.

1118
01:12:38,309 --> 01:12:39,910
- You want a pez?
- No.

1119
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:42,847
Guess who gave me
this for my birthday.

1120
01:12:43,282 --> 01:12:45,680
By the way,
I love that suit!

1121
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:47,860
Thanks, man.

1122
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,265
I wish I had a suit.

1123
01:12:50,565 --> 01:12:54,400
I would even like a suit with
like minimal powers, you know?

1124
01:12:55,049 --> 01:12:58,619
Or maybe, even just
a suit. With no powers.

1125
01:13:13,674 --> 01:13:15,377
What is it?

1126
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:17,454
I don't know.

1127
01:13:21,472 --> 01:13:23,792
It's them.

1128
01:13:25,089 --> 01:13:27,745
They can't be far.

1129
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,104
Hank? Hank?

1130
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,612
Stop it!

1131
01:13:52,581 --> 01:13:54,214
Dad, what's your status?

1132
01:13:54,292 --> 01:13:58,002
Foster's taken care
of. Suiting up, now.

1133
01:14:02,197 --> 01:14:04,212
I just wanted to save Ava.

1134
01:14:04,244 --> 01:14:08,283
She's facing death or something
far more terrible. She's afraid.

1135
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:13,001
I'll help you find a cure when
I get back. I promise.

1136
01:14:13,111 --> 01:14:16,548
Together, we'll figure
something out.

1137
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,134
Good luck, Hank.

1138
01:14:20,426 --> 01:14:22,410
Thanks, Bill.

1139
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:25,845
Now, I'm gonna need
you to step back.

1140
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:46,013
Time remaining:
fifteen minutes.

1141
01:14:47,545 --> 01:14:49,764
Hank's in, Scott.
Any sign of her?

1142
01:14:49,968 --> 01:14:52,491
No. Nothing yet.

1143
01:14:57,209 --> 01:14:58,466
Ava!

1144
01:15:01,272 --> 01:15:03,482
Call off the ants, Scott.

1145
01:15:03,506 --> 01:15:04,849
Oh, boy.

1146
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:31,603
Can I get a status report, cause I got
some serious Ghost problems here!

1147
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:36,056
Ready to dive.

1148
01:15:42,273 --> 01:15:45,867
- In case I don't make it...
- Don't. Don't say that.

1149
01:15:46,461 --> 01:15:48,531
I can't lose you, too.

1150
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:51,109
I love you, Hope.

1151
01:15:51,516 --> 01:15:54,882
Guys, everything's bad
over here. Please...

1152
01:16:09,835 --> 01:16:11,077
Now.

1153
01:16:20,768 --> 01:16:22,376
Misdirection.

1154
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:26,400
One of the first things they teach you
at Online Close-up Magic University.

1155
01:16:28,447 --> 01:16:29,814
No!

1156
01:16:32,486 --> 01:16:34,400
All right. We
got it, Scotty.

1157
01:16:34,658 --> 01:16:38,111
- Meet us at the rendezvous point.
- Okay. On my way.

1158
01:16:38,150 --> 01:16:39,868
Oh, no.

1159
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:43,751
Really?

1160
01:16:43,814 --> 01:16:46,384
- This guy? Again?
- Who?

1161
01:16:46,462 --> 01:16:49,446
I told you our business
wasn't over.

1162
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:53,189
Change of plans.

1163
01:16:55,283 --> 01:16:57,071
Hang on.

1164
01:17:05,385 --> 01:17:08,229
I want that lab, boys.
Whatever it takes.

1165
01:17:17,278 --> 01:17:18,692
Hold on.

1166
01:17:30,324 --> 01:17:31,706
Oh!

1167
01:17:32,043 --> 01:17:33,731
That undercarriage is filthy!

1168
01:17:33,756 --> 01:17:36,011
Now they have
bigger problems.

1169
01:17:40,567 --> 01:17:43,168
Hope, what are you doing? You're
heading away from the rendezvous point.

1170
01:17:43,193 --> 01:17:45,574
Don't worry. I'm taking these
guys on the scenic route.

1171
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:48,136
Wait, what
are you... Oh.

1172
01:17:59,797 --> 01:18:00,929
No!

1173
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:11,480
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, we're
gonna die! We're gonna die!

1174
01:18:23,589 --> 01:18:25,526
Signal lost.

1175
01:18:26,097 --> 01:18:28,761
What the hell are
they doing up there?

1176
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:32,776
Recalibrating.

1177
01:18:47,374 --> 01:18:49,569
Recalibrating.

1178
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,389
You never said it was
so beautiful, Scott.

1179
01:18:59,251 --> 01:19:01,563
Recalibrating.

1180
01:19:04,641 --> 01:19:06,688
Okay. Anytime now.

1181
01:19:06,907 --> 01:19:08,610
Recalibrating.

1182
01:19:11,634 --> 01:19:14,274
- Recalibrating.
- Come on.

1183
01:19:14,461 --> 01:19:16,742
Signal restored.

1184
01:19:29,204 --> 01:19:31,789
Bikes, it's all on you.

1185
01:19:34,868 --> 01:19:37,414
- Take the wheel.
- What? Wait, Hope!

1186
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:49,471
Well, the 60's were fun.
But now, I'm paying for it!

1187
01:19:49,627 --> 01:19:51,150
Be careful up there!

1188
01:19:51,195 --> 01:19:53,853
Give me a break. I haven't
driven in two years.

1189
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:24,995
You got pez'd!

1190
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:28,679
Up here!

1191
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:33,122
Oh, that's not good.

1192
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:37,512
Hope!

1193
01:20:42,781 --> 01:20:43,976
No!

1194
01:20:48,831 --> 01:20:51,777
There it is right there, the lab.
Get it, get, get, get the lab!

1195
01:21:00,332 --> 01:21:02,910
I've got her.
Westbound on Primo.

1196
01:21:05,495 --> 01:21:07,269
Hope! Wait!

1197
01:21:07,294 --> 01:21:09,715
Hey! What about me?

1198
01:21:17,985 --> 01:21:19,657
We got you now, Ava!

1199
01:21:45,891 --> 01:21:47,500
Not again!

1200
01:21:48,789 --> 01:21:50,641
Piece of  junk!

1201
01:21:53,995 --> 01:21:55,510
Yes!

1202
01:21:57,323 --> 01:22:00,034
Go. Go! Go,
go, go, go!

1203
01:22:01,744 --> 01:22:04,829
Burch got the lab.
I'm going after him.

1204
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:16,211
No, no, no,
no, no!

1205
01:22:18,571 --> 01:22:21,383
Work in progress, my ass.

1206
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:38,039
Scott, where are you? I've got
Burch in my sights. Hurry!

1207
01:22:38,064 --> 01:22:41,182
- I'm coming, I'm coming!
- We're running out of time!

1208
01:22:44,517 --> 01:22:48,204
Warning. Approaching
quantum void.

1209
01:23:12,873 --> 01:23:15,115
I'm coming to you, Honey.

1210
01:24:01,388 --> 01:24:02,388
Guys...

1211
01:24:02,739 --> 01:24:04,582
Don't you need the
remote to the lab?

1212
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:05,880
I just found it.

1213
01:24:05,905 --> 01:24:08,436
We can't grow the lab without it.
Get it to us, fast.

1214
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:12,061
- Yeah, but the van is busted.
- Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1215
01:24:14,226 --> 01:24:15,226
Wha?

1216
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:22,423
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1217
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:25,938
The remote! We're missing the remote.
We gotta check the van.

1218
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:29,625
Huh?

1219
01:24:33,211 --> 01:24:35,476
Awesome!

1220
01:25:01,532 --> 01:25:04,227
Hey, I'm going left. But
Burch's boys are all over me.

1221
01:25:04,235 --> 01:25:07,680
- I'm on my way.
- Right. I'll get the lab.

1222
01:25:11,016 --> 01:25:12,016
Hi!

1223
01:25:13,171 --> 01:25:15,381
Oh, that's badass!

1224
01:25:23,526 --> 01:25:24,690
Nice!

1225
01:25:34,373 --> 01:25:35,373
Toink!

1226
01:25:40,481 --> 01:25:44,050
Come here, you little weasel!
Oh, no, you don't!

1227
01:25:46,761 --> 01:25:49,128
I guess... Well,
maybe, you do.

1228
01:25:49,456 --> 01:25:51,136
Come on!

1229
01:26:02,787 --> 01:26:06,177
Anyone see a southern gentleman
carrying a building?

1230
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,538
How did he even have
time to buy a ticket?

1231
01:26:14,437 --> 01:26:17,131
Just one time, please. Work!

1232
01:26:17,725 --> 01:26:20,912
Yes! All right, I need help.

1233
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:22,599
That's it.

1234
01:26:23,521 --> 01:26:25,446
Oh... sorry!

1235
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,052
Hey! Come on, man!

1236
01:26:30,599 --> 01:26:31,997
Not cool!

1237
01:26:32,435 --> 01:26:33,989
Murderers!

1238
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:37,458
Yes! Yes!

1239
01:26:38,472 --> 01:26:44,487
I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas.
'Cause you're a badass! Yes!

1240
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:50,505
No. No. No! Ant-onio!

1241
01:26:52,443 --> 01:26:57,130
Our friends the humpbacks dip in here to the
San Francisco bay for a little leisure,

1242
01:26:57,147 --> 01:26:59,951
- and a little breeding.
- Listen, Uzman...

1243
01:27:01,939 --> 01:27:04,480
Just meet me at the
waterfront in three hours.

1244
01:27:04,505 --> 01:27:08,778
Oh, folks, we barely left the dock, but
it looks like we have some company!

1245
01:27:11,903 --> 01:27:15,598
You see it, folks? There it is. There's a breach.

1246
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,262
What the...

1247
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:26,546
Hi. Sorry. Hi. It's
okay, it's okay.

1248
01:27:26,843 --> 01:27:29,984
Sorry. No, I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

1249
01:27:30,009 --> 01:27:32,600
Hey! That doesn't belong to you.

1250
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:35,524
- No! No! No! No!
- You're embarassing yourself now.

1251
01:27:35,531 --> 01:27:38,132
- Come on. Let go!
- No!

1252
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:39,578
Thank you.

1253
01:27:41,671 --> 01:27:43,358
I'll take this now.

1254
01:27:53,722 --> 01:27:54,948
No...

1255
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:00,995
... melts your mind...

1256
01:28:02,253 --> 01:28:04,378
... a message in your head...

1257
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:09,127
... I had a dream...

1258
01:28:34,506 --> 01:28:36,006
Daddy?

1259
01:28:38,889 --> 01:28:40,162
Dad?

1260
01:28:40,443 --> 01:28:43,926
What's going on? Why
haven't you found Mom?

1261
01:28:45,146 --> 01:28:48,497
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

1262
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:53,067
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

1263
01:29:48,007 --> 01:29:49,530
It's me.

1264
01:30:03,113 --> 01:30:05,113
I'm so sorry!

1265
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:10,277
- It took so long.
- No.

1266
01:30:11,152 --> 01:30:13,003
I do know...

1267
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:15,417
You're here now.

1268
01:30:16,777 --> 01:30:18,737
Let's go home.

1269
01:30:20,269 --> 01:30:22,636
I thought I was gone.

1270
01:30:22,674 --> 01:30:25,658
But that energy from your hands...

1271
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,283
How did you do that?

1272
01:30:30,018 --> 01:30:33,095
I'm not the same woman I
was 30 years ago, Henry.

1273
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,916
This place...

1274
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:37,674
It changes you.

1275
01:30:39,104 --> 01:30:42,338
And adaptation is part of
it, but some of it is...

1276
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,049
Evolution.

1277
01:30:46,112 --> 01:30:50,463
Lab coordinates not found.
Do not ascend.

1278
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:54,681
I should probably tell you what
we're dealing with up there.

1279
01:30:56,002 --> 01:31:01,463
I got the lab. I got the lab.
Move. Move...

1280
01:31:02,049 --> 01:31:03,799
Move!

1281
01:31:03,994 --> 01:31:06,369
Get out of the...

1282
01:31:11,684 --> 01:31:13,254
Let's go.

1283
01:31:14,715 --> 01:31:17,816
No one here appears to
be sure what this is.

1284
01:31:17,841 --> 01:31:21,683
It seems he's
90, 80, 85 feet tall.

1285
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:28,858
Get out of the way!

1286
01:31:28,921 --> 01:31:33,858
I got the lab. The lab! Okay...

1287
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:35,217
The earth feels junky.

1288
01:31:35,234 --> 01:31:38,085
Oh, no. He's too big.

1289
01:31:40,991 --> 01:31:43,639
- Scotty!
- Scott!

1290
01:31:43,757 --> 01:31:45,310
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1291
01:31:45,335 --> 01:31:48,202
I'm just gonna go to sleep
now for five minutes.

1292
01:31:48,218 --> 01:31:52,983
I just need five minutes.
Five minutes...

1293
01:31:59,417 --> 01:32:02,393
You get the lab somewhere safe.
Scott's air won't last!

1294
01:32:02,401 --> 01:32:03,572
Okay!

1295
01:32:18,632 --> 01:32:21,186
Move. Move. Move!

1296
01:32:23,952 --> 01:32:25,694
No, wait!

1297
01:32:51,488 --> 01:32:53,597
Lab at full scale.

1298
01:32:53,605 --> 01:32:55,926
- They did it!
- Ready to ascend.

1299
01:32:55,965 --> 01:32:58,168
Let's go see our daughter.

1300
01:33:19,628 --> 01:33:20,870
Scott.

1301
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:23,932
Scott!

1302
01:33:24,308 --> 01:33:26,706
Scott, come on. Wake up.

1303
01:33:40,084 --> 01:33:43,334
Come on. Come on.
Where are you, Scott?

1304
01:33:45,158 --> 01:33:46,385
Gotcha.

1305
01:33:50,276 --> 01:33:51,556
Scott?

1306
01:33:57,947 --> 01:33:59,111
Hey!

1307
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,737
Hey, Scotty. Hope, come in.

1308
01:34:04,762 --> 01:34:07,387
Do you take any questions
'bout the building?

1309
01:34:08,764 --> 01:34:11,347
- Sco...
- Where's the remote, Luis?

1310
01:34:12,087 --> 01:34:14,188
It's probably in there.

1311
01:34:14,353 --> 01:34:15,743
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1312
01:34:15,939 --> 01:34:19,751
I guess this is where
we say, Adios, amigo.

1313
01:34:20,337 --> 01:34:21,547
No, no, no!

1314
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:26,909
Thanks, guys.

1315
01:34:32,656 --> 01:34:35,351
Ava? Ava!

1316
01:34:39,108 --> 01:34:40,108
Ava.

1317
01:34:40,483 --> 01:34:44,123
- Almost ready for extraction.
- Please, stop. People are getting hurt.

1318
01:34:44,131 --> 01:34:47,014
Everything hurts. Don't
talk to me about pain.

1319
01:34:47,038 --> 01:34:50,209
What if Hank was right? What
if this process kills Janet?

1320
01:34:50,459 --> 01:34:51,882
You're worried about her?

1321
01:34:51,907 --> 01:34:55,180
All I'm saying is she's a brilliant
scientist. She may be able to help.

1322
01:34:55,204 --> 01:34:57,914
Oh, she will help. Right now.

1323
01:34:57,938 --> 01:35:00,235
And if she dies, she dies!

1324
01:35:01,703 --> 01:35:05,328
I'm sorry, we can't do this.
We have to find another way.

1325
01:35:08,015 --> 01:35:10,179
This is the way.

1326
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,399
Janet!

1327
01:35:43,188 --> 01:35:44,823
She's starting the extraction.

1328
01:35:44,848 --> 01:35:47,134
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1329
01:35:55,658 --> 01:35:56,931
No!

1330
01:36:30,986 --> 01:36:32,150
Hope!

1331
01:36:49,454 --> 01:36:50,797
Are you okay?

1332
01:37:05,204 --> 01:37:06,500
Mom?

1333
01:37:15,139 --> 01:37:17,131
Oh, my God.

1334
01:37:21,342 --> 01:37:22,896
We found you.

1335
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:28,428
I missed you so much.

1336
01:37:29,295 --> 01:37:32,052
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1337
01:37:33,989 --> 01:37:39,224
It's okay. I'm, I'm here now.
We have time.

1338
01:37:40,233 --> 01:37:42,787
No more last minute
business trips, okay?

1339
01:37:43,897 --> 01:37:45,209
I promise.

1340
01:37:45,295 --> 01:37:48,349
It's okay, it's fine.
Don't worry about me.

1341
01:37:48,444 --> 01:37:50,326
- I'll be fine.
- Dad!

1342
01:37:55,273 --> 01:37:56,499
Scott.

1343
01:37:57,039 --> 01:37:58,672
Miss Van Dyne.

1344
01:38:00,242 --> 01:38:01,632
It's nice to...

1345
01:38:01,945 --> 01:38:04,132
I guess we've already met.

1346
01:38:04,648 --> 01:38:06,124
I guess we have.

1347
01:38:08,992 --> 01:38:10,343
Wait.

1348
01:38:18,149 --> 01:38:20,117
Your pain...

1349
01:38:21,336 --> 01:38:23,508
I can feel it.

1350
01:38:25,836 --> 01:38:27,337
It hurts.

1351
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:31,493
It always hurts.

1352
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,300
I'm sorry.

1353
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:40,902
I think I can help you.

1354
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:16,863
Do you know she could do that?

1355
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:21,574
It's okay.

1356
01:39:23,535 --> 01:39:27,035
Guys, the cops are coming. Whoa!

1357
01:39:27,145 --> 01:39:28,402
The, uhh, the...

1358
01:39:28,449 --> 01:39:32,097
The cops are coming.
Like all of them.

1359
01:39:32,137 --> 01:39:34,832
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go.

1360
01:39:35,121 --> 01:39:37,246
What about them?

1361
01:39:40,067 --> 01:39:41,488
Hands in the air!

1362
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,496
No. No, no,
we do our jobs.

1363
01:39:43,521 --> 01:39:45,989
You see, we see these guys,
they trying to shoot people.

1364
01:39:46,005 --> 01:39:48,935
So we apprehended them. For you.
You're welcome.

1365
01:39:49,005 --> 01:39:53,246
- We traffic in stolen technology.
- And they have killed many, many people.

1366
01:39:53,271 --> 01:39:56,481
- He's in charge.
- That's true. I am.

1367
01:39:56,818 --> 01:40:00,442
I've also committed numerous healthcode
violations in my restaurant.

1368
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:03,349
Some of them would shock you.

1369
01:40:05,747 --> 01:40:07,715
It is truth serum.

1370
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,005
We gotta get out
of here. Fast.

1371
01:40:16,428 --> 01:40:17,887
I have an idea.

1372
01:40:17,912 --> 01:40:21,279
Giant figure now spotted at the
intersection of Broadway and Wycona.

1373
01:40:21,303 --> 01:40:23,888
- All units move in.
- Go. Go.

1374
01:40:27,102 --> 01:40:29,367
There he is.

1375
01:40:33,312 --> 01:40:35,163
It's over, Scotty.

1376
01:40:35,179 --> 01:40:37,476
I'm sorry but we got you, man.

1377
01:40:37,992 --> 01:40:41,554
Come on, it's the end of the line, pal.
There's nowhere to hide.

1378
01:40:43,187 --> 01:40:46,351
Just pull off that band-aid.
You lost. it's okay.

1379
01:40:48,031 --> 01:40:51,030
Dammit, Scotty! Reduce yourself!

1380
01:40:56,237 --> 01:40:57,651
Magic?

1381
01:41:00,237 --> 01:41:03,158
Dammit. Get to Lang's. Now.

1382
01:41:09,684 --> 01:41:11,801
Well done, Honey.

1383
01:41:11,903 --> 01:41:13,434
Let's go!

1384
01:41:21,545 --> 01:41:23,670
- Leave me here.
- We can make it.

1385
01:41:23,702 --> 01:41:25,717
You said it yourself.

1386
01:41:26,256 --> 01:41:28,162
I've hurt people.

1387
01:41:28,592 --> 01:41:30,115
But you haven't.

1388
01:41:30,373 --> 01:41:33,685
- Go, please.
- We can make it, Ava.

1389
01:41:33,857 --> 01:41:35,013
Bill...

1390
01:41:35,583 --> 01:41:37,568
I'm not leaving you.

1391
01:42:21,247 --> 01:42:22,497
Oh, hey guys.

1392
01:42:23,138 --> 01:42:25,270
Are my two years up already?

1393
01:42:31,806 --> 01:42:34,923
What's it like out there?
I mean...

1394
01:42:35,095 --> 01:42:39,040
Do people still dance? Are
food trucks still a thing?

1395
01:42:39,297 --> 01:42:42,117
You got away with it
this time, Scott, but...

1396
01:42:42,336 --> 01:42:44,476
I'll be seeing you again.

1397
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:45,968
Where?

1398
01:42:46,625 --> 01:42:47,625
Huh?

1399
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:50,031
Where will you be
seeing me again?

1400
01:42:50,133 --> 01:42:51,203
Like...

1401
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:55,765
in general, I'll see you. Like, the
next time you do something bad.

1402
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:57,524
- I'll be there. To catch you.
- Ohh.

1403
01:42:57,618 --> 01:43:01,657
You'll be watching me. I thought
you were inviting me somewhere.

1404
01:43:02,821 --> 01:43:04,422
Why would I do that?

1405
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:06,656
That's what I was wondering.
Why would you do that either?

1406
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:08,585
Like a party, or
dinner or something?

1407
01:43:08,601 --> 01:43:10,795
I don't know. I thought you
were planning the evening.

1408
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:13,187
No. I meant to, like, arrest you.
Like, I'll arrest you later again.

1409
01:43:13,203 --> 01:43:14,690
- Take it easy.
- Okay.

1410
01:43:16,529 --> 01:43:17,927
Did you wanna go out
tonight or something?

1411
01:43:17,943 --> 01:43:21,302
I mean, 'cause I'm free.
Yeah. Come on.

1412
01:43:30,838 --> 01:43:33,338
- You ready?
- Yes!

1413
01:43:34,229 --> 01:43:36,463
- Daddy!
- Hi!

1414
01:43:39,434 --> 01:43:41,332
Yes, that was a...

1415
01:43:41,816 --> 01:43:44,862
- 8:30, Monday.
- Sounds great.

1416
01:43:45,347 --> 01:43:48,862
Mr. Karapetyan?
Yeah, you saw that?

1417
01:43:49,042 --> 01:43:52,504
Well, it would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1418
01:43:52,668 --> 01:43:55,315
I'll see you Thursday, 9 A.M.
Okay.

1419
01:44:27,837 --> 01:44:29,766
This is awesome.

1420
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:31,626
So, Cassie...

1421
01:44:31,704 --> 01:44:33,821
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

1422
01:44:33,962 --> 01:44:37,547
I wanna help people.
Like my Dad.

1423
01:44:38,102 --> 01:44:39,399
Really?

1424
01:44:40,376 --> 01:44:42,172
I wanted to be his partner.

1425
01:44:42,244 --> 01:44:44,353
But he said he wants you.

1426
01:44:44,924 --> 01:44:46,439
Is that so?

1427
01:44:50,564 --> 01:44:51,806
Daddy!

1428
01:44:53,376 --> 01:44:54,579
Hold on.

1429
01:44:55,408 --> 01:44:57,704
- Move! Get outta here!
- No. Don't. Don't!

1430
01:45:00,728 --> 01:45:02,462
Oh! Gross.

1431
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:05,111
Ugh. I hate that moth dust.

1432
01:45:05,283 --> 01:45:09,290
Go. Shoo! Shoo!
